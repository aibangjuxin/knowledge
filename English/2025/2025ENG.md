### **2. Key Contributions**

|**Area**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**üîí Zero-Downtime mTLS Migration**|Executed a seamless migration from TCP mTLS to HTTPS mTLS with zero traffic disruption, leveraging GCP Certificate Manager, Trust Config, Cloud Armor, Backend Services, and custom header mechanisms. This solution significantly simplified component configuration and enhanced security.|
|**üß© Component Optimization & Configuration Enhancement**|Optimized core component configuration file structures, log rotation mechanisms, and service startup sequences. Streamlined and automated configurations for key components like Kong, Nginx, and Runtime, improving deployment consistency and maintainability.|
|**üõ°Ô∏è High Availability Enhancement (GKE Upgrade Scenario)**|Addressed transient disruptions during GKE node upgrades by implementing PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB) and affinity configurations, ensuring high availability and stability during rolling updates.|
|**üöÄ Pub/Sub & Java Scheduler Optimization**|Conducted in-depth analysis and troubleshooting of Java schedulers, optimizing message processing logic and Pub/Sub asynchronous consumption performance. This reduced task latency and improved overall system responsiveness.|
|**üåê Cloud Armor Rule Enforcement**|Promoted and implemented Cloud Armor rule sets, enabling protection policies (including mTLS validation and IP whitelisting) for multiple environments. Provided SRE teams with implementation support documents and automation scripts.|
|**üìä Monitoring & Alerting Optimization**|Adjusted CPU / Memory monitoring thresholds and improved alerting notification mechanisms to ensure issues are caught and responded to quickly.|
|**üß± Cloud Run Infra Support**|Provided Cloud Run network architecture support for multi-team POCs, assisting with the configuration of VPC Connectors, NAT, and access controls, and produced standardized onboarding documentation.|
|**üß† AI Internal Adoption**|Promoted the internal use of AI tools (like ChatGPT, Vertex AI) to improve development and debugging efficiency, producing internal guidelines and usage examples.|
|**üß∞ Violation Remediation & Security Hardening**|Led the remediation of multiple security vulnerabilities (including CWE-type issues), followed up on DAST scans and component updates, and improved the vulnerability management lifecycle.|
|**üßæ Support Case Reduction & Process Improvement**|Collected and analyzed Support2 cases, identified root causes, and drove process improvements to enhance support efficiency and platform stability.|
|**üìà PM & Jira Dashboard Optimization**|Established a PM Dashboard and Jira views for task status visualization and automated reporting, providing data-driven support for management decisions.|
