Seamless Migration from TCP mTLS to GCP HTTPS mTLS with Zero Service Impact

### Summary:  
In Q2, Lex led the end-to-end release of a new HTTPS + mTLS architecture across our API platform, delivering a major security uplift while ensuring zero impact to online services. 
This release directly enhances our client identity assurance, aligns with enterprise-level compliance, and lays the foundation for multi-tenant client authentication via Google Cloud Load Balancer and Certificate Manager.

### Key Highlights:

-  No User Impact: Seamlessly migrated all external services and partners to the new HTTPS + mTLS channel, with zero downtime, and ensured no behavior change for existing integrations.

- Security Uplift: Introduced a stronger client authentication model using mTLS with CA trust chain enforcement. The design ensures only verified clients can connect to sensitive backend APIs.

- Simplified Architecture: Consolidated from a custom Nginx-based TCP/SSL stack to a fully-managed Google Cloud Load Balancing (GLB) solution, utilizing:
  - Certificate Manager TrustConfig
  - BackendService with SSL policies
  - Cloud Armor and IP whitelisting
  - Per-client validation via custom headers

-  Platform Impact:
  - Reduced operational complexity of onboarding new clients with dynamic CA trust injection.
  - Enabled future scalability for multi-CA management through structured fingerprint metadata and YAML-based TrustConfig templates.
  - Established a unified point of control for certificate lifecycle and access policies.

### Business Value:
- Strengthened our platformâ€™s zero-trust posture without disrupting online workloads.
- Enhanced user trust and partner confidence in our security baseline.
- Set a reusable foundation for other teams seeking secure client-to-service mTLS adoption.
