3.  **Editing:** Edit all visuals to match the brand's established aesthetic (e.g., using a specific Lightroom preset).
4.  **Caption Writing:** Write a draft caption for each post. It should be engaging and align with the brand's tone of voice.
5.  **Hashtag Research:** Compile a list of relevant hashtags, mixing popular, niche, and branded tags.
