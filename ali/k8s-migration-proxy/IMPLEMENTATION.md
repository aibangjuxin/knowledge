# Task 1 Implementation: 创建代理服务基础架构

## Implementation Summary

This task has been completed successfully. The basic infrastructure for the Nginx proxy service has been created with all required components for K8s cluster migration.

## Files Created

### Core Infrastructure
1. **`nginx-configmap.yaml`** - Nginx configuration with:
   - Upstream definitions for old and new clusters
   - Health check endpoints (/health, /ready)
   - Request forwarding logic
   - Comprehensive logging for monitoring
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **`deployment.yaml`** - Nginx proxy deployment with:
   - 2 replicas for high availability
   - Liveness and readiness probes
   - Security context (non-root, read-only filesystem)
   - Resource limits and requests
   - Anti-affinity rules for pod distribution

3. **`service.yaml`** - Service definitions:
   - ClusterIP service for internal access
   - Headless service for direct pod access
   - Health endpoint exposure on port 8080

4. **`external-service.yaml`** - ExternalName service:
   - Points to new cluster endpoint
   - Enables DNS resolution for new cluster services

5. **`servicemonitor.yaml`** - Prometheus monitoring:
   - Health endpoint monitoring
   - Integration with Prometheus operator

### Deployment and Testing Tools
6. **`deploy.sh`** - Automated deployment script
7. **`validate.sh`** - Infrastructure validation script
8. **`test-proxy.sh`** - Functionality testing script
9. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
10. **`IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This implementation summary

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 2.1: Request Forwarding Mechanism ✅
- ✅ Nginx proxy configured to forward requests from old cluster to new cluster
- ✅ Upstream definitions for both old and new clusters
- ✅ Request headers preserved during forwarding
- ✅ Host, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Proto headers maintained

### Requirement 2.2: Error Handling and Logging ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with `proxy_next_upstream` configuration
- ✅ Detailed access logs including upstream information and response times
- ✅ Error logs with appropriate log levels
- ✅ Fallback mechanism to old cluster when new cluster is unavailable

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Health Checks and Probes
- **Liveness Probe**: `/health` endpoint on port 8080
- **Readiness Probe**: `/ready` endpoint that checks upstream connectivity
- **Initial delays and timeouts** configured appropriately

### 2. Security Configuration
- **Non-root execution**: Container runs as user 101
- **Read-only root filesystem**: Enhanced security posture
- **Dropped capabilities**: Minimal required permissions
- **Security context**: Applied at both pod and container level

### 3. High Availability
- **Multiple replicas**: 2 replicas for redundancy
- **Anti-affinity rules**: Pods distributed across different nodes
- **Resource management**: Requests and limits configured

### 4. Monitoring Integration
- **ServiceMonitor**: Prometheus integration for metrics collection
- **Health endpoint**: Available for external monitoring
- **Detailed logging**: Request tracing and performance metrics

### 5. Network Configuration
- **Upstream keepalive**: Connection pooling for better performance
- **Timeout settings**: Appropriate timeouts for proxy operations
- **Buffer configuration**: Optimized for request handling

## Current Behavior

The proxy is currently configured to:
1. **Route all traffic to the old cluster** (migration_percentage = 0)
2. **Provide health check endpoints** for monitoring
3. **Log all requests** with detailed information
4. **Handle errors gracefully** with fallback to old cluster

## Next Steps

This infrastructure is ready for the next tasks:

1. **Task 2**: Implement gradual migration configuration management
   - Add ConfigMap-based migration percentage control
   - Implement weight-based traffic splitting
   - Add dynamic configuration updates

2. **Task 3**: Configure ExternalName services (partially completed)
   - The basic ExternalName service is created
   - Network connectivity verification needed

3. **Task 4**: Implement Ingress configuration updates
   - Configure Ingress to route traffic to migration-proxy service
   - Add gradual routing rules

## Verification Steps

To verify the implementation:

1. **Deploy the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Validate the deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./validate.sh
   ```

3. **Test functionality**:
   ```bash
   ./test-proxy.sh
   ```

4. **Check pod status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n aibang-1111111111-bbdm -l app=migration-proxy
   ```

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation aligns with the design document architecture:
- ✅ Nginx proxy service in old cluster
- ✅ Upstream definitions for old and new clusters
- ✅ Health check mechanisms
- ✅ Monitoring integration
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ High availability configuration

The basic infrastructure is now ready to support the gradual migration process as outlined in the overall migration strategy.
