# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a comprehensive automation platform for Google Cloud Run job management, standardizing deployment processes, task lifecycle management, and operational workflows. The system will enable automated onboarding, deployment pipelines, task management, and cleanup operations for Cloud Run jobs across multiple regions and projects, with integrated VPC connectivity and security controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to standardize Cloud Run job deployments with consistent VPC connectivity and security configurations, so that all jobs follow organizational best practices and security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new Cloud Run job is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically configure Serverless VPC Access Connector connectivity
2. WHEN deploying a job THEN the system SHALL enforce standard resource limits (CPU: 1, Memory: 512Mi-2Gi range)
3. WHEN creating a job THEN the system SHALL automatically assign appropriate service accounts with least-privilege permissions
4. IF a job requires external connectivity THEN the system SHALL configure Cloud NAT routing through VPC
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL enforce encryption using customer-managed keys (CMEK)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment pipelines for Cloud Run jobs, so that I can deploy applications consistently across environments without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to a repository THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger image build and deployment pipeline
2. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL use Cloud Build or GitHub Actions for container creation
3. WHEN deploying jobs THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL automatically update job configurations with new image versions
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated task lifecycle management, so that I can schedule, monitor, and clean up Cloud Run jobs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating scheduled tasks THEN the system SHALL integrate with Cloud Scheduler for automated execution
2. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL capture execution logs and status information
3. WHEN jobs fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN tasks are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated cleanup and deletion
5. WHEN monitoring jobs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status and health checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized onboarding process for new Cloud Run jobs, so that I can quickly deploy applications without learning complex GCP configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN onboarding a new service THEN the system SHALL provide template-based job creation
2. WHEN configuring jobs THEN the system SHALL validate all required parameters and dependencies
3. WHEN setting up networking THEN the system SHALL automatically configure VPC connectors and firewall rules
4. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL integrate with Secret Manager for secure credential handling
5. WHEN deploying across regions THEN the system SHALL support multi-region deployment strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want comprehensive job management capabilities, so that I can list, filter, update, and delete Cloud Run jobs across multiple projects and regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing jobs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by project, region, status, and labels
2. WHEN updating jobs THEN the system SHALL support batch operations for multiple jobs simultaneously
3. WHEN deleting jobs THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and provide safe deletion with dependency checks
4. WHEN managing cross-region jobs THEN the system SHALL provide unified management interface
5. WHEN auditing changes THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs of all job operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want automated security compliance for Cloud Run jobs, so that all deployments meet organizational security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying jobs THEN the system SHALL enforce non-root container execution
2. WHEN configuring networking THEN the system SHALL implement network policies and egress controls
3. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL use Secret Manager with proper IAM bindings
4. WHEN enabling logging THEN the system SHALL configure structured logging with appropriate retention
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL validate security scanning results for container images

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cost optimization specialist, I want automated resource management and cleanup, so that unused Cloud Run jobs don't incur unnecessary costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jobs are idle THEN the system SHALL identify and flag unused resources for cleanup
2. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL provide cost reporting and optimization recommendations
3. WHEN cleaning up resources THEN the system SHALL safely remove associated networking and storage resources
4. WHEN managing job lifecycles THEN the system SHALL implement automatic scaling and timeout policies
5. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL alert on budget thresholds and unusual spending patterns
