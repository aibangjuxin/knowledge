Our platform provides performance testing in the PPD environment with support for up to 500 TPS. After deploying your API to PPD, we can either conduct the testing for you or you may run the tests yourself. The underlying infrastructure is configured with auto-scaling for both instances and GKE clusters, ensuring capacity can adjust as needed. In addition, our SRE team continuously monitors the system and manages scaling to maintain stability and performance.
