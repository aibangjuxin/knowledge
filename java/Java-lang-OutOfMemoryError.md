# The Q 
GCP logs explorer

```bash
Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```
- the output 
```bash
textPayload: "Exception in thread "https-jsse-nio-8443-Poller" java.lang.OutfMemoryError: Java heap space
at java.base/java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMapSKeySetView.iterator(Unknown Source)
at java.base/java.util.CollectionsSUnmodifiableCollectionS1.<init>(Unknown Source) at java.base/java.util.CollectionsSUnmodifiableCollection.iterator(Unknown Source)

at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.NioEndpointSPoller.run(NioEndpoint.java: 798)
at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)"
```

### Key Points
- It seems likely that the `Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error in your GCP logs is due to insufficient heap size for your Tomcat application, especially given the stack trace pointing to Tomcat's NioEndpoint Poller thread.
- Research suggests increasing the heap size by adjusting JVM options like `-Xms` and `-Xmx` can help, but the exact method depends on your deployment (e.g., Compute Engine or Kubernetes).
- The evidence leans toward checking for memory leaks and optimizing Tomcat configurations, such as connection settings, to prevent future issues.

---

### Understanding the Error
The `Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error means the JVM has run out of memory in the heap, where objects are stored. Your stack trace shows this happening in Tomcat's NioEndpoint Poller thread, suggesting high memory usage related to network connections or timeouts. This is common in web applications under heavy load.

### Steps to Analyze and Debug
To fix this, start by increasing the heap size:
- **For Compute Engine**: Edit the `setenv.sh` file in Tomcat's `bin` directory, adding `export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m"` and restart Tomcat.
- **For Kubernetes**: Update your deployment YAML to include `CATALINA_OPTS` with the same settings and apply the changes.

Next, generate heap dumps by adding `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/dump` to `CATALINA_OPTS`, then analyze them with tools like Eclipse MAT to find memory leaks. Also, review Tomcat's `server.xml` to optimize settings like `maxThreads` and `maxConnections`.

Finally, ensure your GCP resources (instance memory or pod limits) are sufficient, and monitor memory usage with tools like VisualVM.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis and Debugging Process for Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError in GCP Logs Explorer

This section provides a comprehensive guide to analyzing and debugging the `Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error observed in your GCP logs explorer, particularly with the provided stack trace related to Tomcat's NioEndpoint. The process is tailored for a GCP environment, considering deployment options like Compute Engine or Kubernetes, and includes all necessary details for a thorough investigation.

#### Background and Error Context
The `Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error occurs when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) cannot allocate more memory in the heap space, which is used to store objects created by the application. The stack trace provided indicates the error is occurring in a thread named "https-jsse-nio-8443-Poller," specifically within `org.apache.tomcat.util.net.NioEndpoint`'s `timeout` method. This suggests the issue is related to Tomcat's Non-Blocking I/O (NIO) configuration, particularly the Poller thread responsible for managing connection timeouts.

Common causes include:
- Insufficient heap size allocated to the JVM, especially under high load.
- Memory leaks in the application code, where objects are not garbage collected.
- Misconfigured Tomcat settings, such as excessive connection threads or timeouts.
- Resource constraints in the GCP environment, such as limited instance memory or pod resource limits.

Given the context of GCP logs explorer, it's likely your application is deployed on Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, or another GCP service, each with different configuration implications.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis and Debugging Process

##### Step 1: Understand the Environment and Deployment
First, determine how Tomcat is deployed in GCP:
- **Compute Engine**: Tomcat is installed directly on a virtual machine instance.
- **Kubernetes Engine**: Tomcat is containerized and deployed as pods.
- **App Engine**: Less common for Tomcat, but possible with custom runtimes.

This affects how you adjust JVM settings and monitor resources. For example, Compute Engine allows direct file edits, while Kubernetes requires container configuration changes.

##### Step 2: Increase Java Heap Size
The most immediate solution is to increase the heap size, as the default might be insufficient. The JVM options `-Xms` (initial heap size) and `-Xmx` (maximum heap size) are key.

- **For Compute Engine**:
  - Locate the Tomcat installation directory, typically under `/path/to/tomcat`.
  - Open or create the `setenv.sh` file in the `bin` directory.
  - Add or modify the following line:
    ```bash
    export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m"
    ```
    - `-Xms1024m`: Sets initial heap to 1024 MB.
    - `-Xmx2048m`: Sets maximum heap to 2048 MB.
  - Save the file and restart Tomcat:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart tomcat
    ```
  - Verify the changes by checking logs or adding `-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal` to `CATALINA_OPTS` to print JVM flags.

- **For Kubernetes**:
  - Edit your deployment YAML file. Locate the container running Tomcat and add or modify the environment variables:
    ```yaml
    env:
    - name: CATALINA_OPTS
      value: "-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m"
    ```
  - Ensure resource limits are sufficient:
    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "2Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "4Gi"
    ```
  - Apply the changes:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```
  - This restarts the pods with updated settings.

- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure the GCP instance or node has enough physical memory. For Compute Engine, check in the GCP Console under "VM instances" and resize if needed.
  - For Kubernetes, ensure node pools have adequate resources.

##### Step 3: Generate and Analyze Heap Dumps
To identify memory leaks or excessive usage, configure heap dump generation:
- Add the following to `CATALINA_OPTS`:
  ```bash
  export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/dump"
  ```
  - Replace `/path/to/dump` with a writable directory, e.g., `/tmp/heapdump.hprof`.
- When the error occurs, a heap dump file will be generated. Analyze it using:
  - **Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT)**: Download from [eclipse.org/mat/](https://www.eclipse.org/mat/) and open the `.hprof` file. Look for large objects, memory leaks, or objects not being garbage collected.
  - **jhat**: Use the command `jhat /path/to/dump` for a basic analysis, though MAT is recommended for detailed insights.
- Focus on:
  - Objects with high retention, indicating potential leaks.
  - Large collections or arrays consuming significant memory.

##### Step 4: Optimize Tomcat Configuration
Given the stack trace points to the NioEndpoint Poller, review Tomcat's configuration:
- Open `server.xml` in the Tomcat `conf` directory.
- Locate the `Connector` element for port 8443 (HTTPS), typically:
  ```xml
  <Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
             maxThreads="200" minSpareThreads="25" maxConnections="10000"
             acceptCount="100" connectionTimeout="20000" />
  ```
- Adjust the following for optimization:
  - **maxThreads**: Reduce if your application doesn't need many concurrent threads, e.g., set to 100.
  - **maxConnections**: Limit to prevent overwhelming the Poller, e.g., 5000.
  - **connectionTimeout**: Reduce if connections are held open too long, e.g., 10000 ms.
  - **pollerThreadCount**: Add or adjust, e.g., `<Connector ... pollerThreadCount="2" ... />` to manage Poller threads better.

- Restart Tomcat after changes to apply.

##### Step 5: Monitor and Tune Application Code
Use profiling tools to identify memory-intensive areas:
- **VisualVM**: Download from [visualvm.github.io/](https://visualvm.github.io/) and connect to your JVM. Monitor heap usage and take snapshots.
- **YourKit**: A commercial tool for detailed profiling, focusing on memory leaks.
- Look for:
  - Unclosed resources (e.g., database connections, files) using `try-with-resources` or explicit closing.
  - Large collections (e.g., Lists, Maps) that grow unbounded; consider clearing or limiting size.
  - Static variables holding references to objects, preventing garbage collection.

- Review application logs for patterns, such as errors before the `OutOfMemoryError`, indicating resource exhaustion.

##### Step 6: Verify GCP Resource Allocation
Ensure your GCP environment supports the increased memory needs:
- **Compute Engine**: Check instance type in the GCP Console (e.g., "VM instances"). If memory is low, resize to a larger machine type, e.g., from e2-medium (2 vCPUs, 4 GB) to e2-standard-2 (2 vCPUs, 8 GB).
- **Kubernetes**: Ensure node pools have sufficient memory and adjust pod resource requests/limits as shown above.

- Monitor using GCP's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver), accessible via [console.cloud.google.com/monitoring](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring), for memory usage trends.

#### Additional Considerations
- **Memory Leaks vs. High Load**: If increasing heap size doesn't help, the issue might be a memory leak. Regular heap dump analysis is crucial.
- **Tomcat Version**: Ensure you're using a recent version (e.g., Tomcat 9 or 10) for better memory management. Check [tomcat.apache.org](https://tomcat.apache.org/) for updates.
- **GCP Logging**: Use GCP logs explorer to correlate memory errors with application events, helping identify triggers.

#### Example Configurations
Below is a table summarizing common configurations for increasing heap size:

| Deployment Type | Configuration File/Method                     | Example Command/Setting                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Compute Engine  | `setenv.sh` in Tomcat `bin`                  | `export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m"`     |
| Kubernetes      | Deployment YAML, `env` section               | `value: "-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m"` in `CATALINA_OPTS`|
| Heap Dump       | Add to `CATALINA_OPTS`                       | `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp` |

This table provides a quick reference for implementing changes based on your deployment.

#### Conclusion
By following these steps—increasing heap size, generating and analyzing heap dumps, optimizing Tomcat, monitoring application code, and ensuring GCP resources are adequate—you should be able to resolve the `Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error. Monitor the application post-changes and iterate based on observed behavior. For further assistance, consult Tomcat documentation at [tomcat.apache.org](https://tomcat.apache.org/) and GCP resources at [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com).




# Default JVM options 
### Key Points
- Research suggests that if you haven’t set JVM options, you can view the default configuration by running a specific command.
- It seems likely that the defaults are determined by your Java installation and operating system, and may vary by version and platform.

### How to View Default JVM Configuration
If you haven’t set any JVM options, the Java Virtual Machine uses default settings based on your installation. To see these defaults, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version
```

This command will list all configured flags, including defaults like heap size and garbage collection settings, showing over 500 lines of output with details such as `int ActiveProcessorCount = -1` and `size_t InitialHeapSize = 268435456`.

### Why This Matters
Understanding default JVM options helps diagnose issues like memory errors and optimize performance, especially in environments like GCP where applications like Tomcat might rely on these settings.

---

### Survey Note: Viewing Default JVM Configuration Without Explicit Settings

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of how to view the default Java Virtual Machine (JVM) configuration when no custom options have been explicitly set, tailored for users in a GCP environment, such as those managing Tomcat applications. The process is grounded in standard Java practices and supported by multiple reliable sources, ensuring a thorough understanding for both technical and non-technical audiences.

#### Background and Context
The JVM, an interpretive computing engine, runs compiled Java programs by translating byte codes into native instructions of the host machine. When no custom JVM options are set, the JVM relies on default settings determined by the Java installation, operating system, and version. These defaults are critical for performance, especially in cloud environments like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), where applications may face memory constraints, as seen in the earlier discussion about `Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` errors in Tomcat logs.

The user’s query, asked at 03:28 PM JST on Thursday, July 10, 2025, seeks to understand how to view these default configurations without having set them explicitly. Given the context of GCP and Tomcat, it’s likely the user is troubleshooting or optimizing a Java application, but the question is general enough to apply to any Java environment.

#### Direct Method to View Default JVM Options
Research suggests the most straightforward way to view the default JVM configuration is by using the command:

```bash
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version
```

This command prints all currently configured flags and their values, including defaults, to the console. The output is extensive, typically over 500 lines, listing flags such as:
- `int ActiveProcessorCount = -1`
- `bool UseCompressedOops = true`
- `size_t InitialHeapSize = 268435456` (e.g., 256 MB in bytes)

These flags cover heap size settings (e.g., `-Xms` and `-Xmx` for initial and maximum heap), garbage collection options, and other performance-related parameters. The `-version` flag ensures the command also displays the Java version, which is useful for context, as defaults can vary by JVM version and platform.

For example, on a system with Java SE 11, running this command might show `InitialHeapSize` as 256 MB by default, but this can differ based on architecture (e.g., 64-bit vs. 32-bit) and operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, Solaris).

#### Supporting Evidence and Sources
The evidence leans toward this method being standard, supported by multiple sources. TheServerSide.com, a reputable Java resource, explicitly mentions `-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version` as a way to print all configured flags, including defaults, as seen in their JVM options cheat sheet. Oracle’s official documentation on Java HotSpot VM Options also lists various flags and their defaults, though it doesn’t provide a single command for listing all; instead, it notes that defaults are platform-specific and listed for Java SE 6 for Solaris Sparc with `-server`, with variations noted per architecture/OS/JVM version.

Additionally, Baeldung’s guide on JVM parameters, while focused on setting options, mentions default behaviors like the unlimited maximum size of the Young Generation, reinforcing that defaults exist and can be viewed. The Oracle documentation for JDK 8 and later, accessible via [Windows](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html) and [Solaris](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html), further supports that defaults are part of the JVM’s configuration, though viewing them requires the aforementioned command.

#### Considerations for GCP and Tomcat
In the context of GCP, especially for Tomcat deployments on Compute Engine or Kubernetes, the default JVM options might be influenced by startup scripts (e.g., `catalina.sh` or `setenv.sh`) or environment variables like `JAVA_OPTS`. However, if no such customizations are made, the JVM’s built-in defaults apply. For instance, in the earlier discussion, increasing heap size with `-Xms` and `-Xmx` was suggested, but viewing defaults first helps understand the baseline.

For Kubernetes, pod resource limits might also affect effective defaults, but the `java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version` command still shows the JVM’s internal settings. For Compute Engine, ensure the instance has sufficient memory to handle the defaults, as seen in resizing recommendations from e2-medium to e2-standard-2 for better performance.

#### Alternative Methods and Tools
While `-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal` is the primary method, other tools can provide insights:
- **jinfo -flag**: Mentioned in Oracle’s documentation, this can query specific flags for a running JVM, but it requires the JVM to be running and doesn’t list all defaults at once.
- **JConsole or HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean API**: These can monitor and manage flags, as shown in Oracle’s monitoring guide, but are more for runtime analysis than viewing initial defaults.

However, for the user’s purpose of viewing defaults without custom settings, the command-line approach is simplest and most direct.

#### Table: Comparison of Methods to View JVM Options

| Method                     | Description                                      | Best Use Case                          | Limitations                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version` | Lists all configured flags, including defaults | Viewing all default settings at once   | Requires command-line access, verbose output |
| `jinfo -flag`              | Queries specific flags for a running JVM        | Runtime flag inspection                | Needs running JVM, not comprehensive     |
| JConsole/HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean | Monitors and manages flags via GUI/API          | Runtime monitoring and debugging       | Not for initial default viewing, complex setup |

This table helps users choose the right method based on their needs, especially in a GCP environment where command-line access is common.

#### Detailed Process and Examples
To use the command, open a terminal, ensure Java is installed (check with `java -version`), and run:

```bash
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version
```

The output will include lines like:
- `uintx InitialHeapSize := 268435456 {product}`
- `uintx MaxHeapSize := 4294967296 {product}`

These indicate the initial and maximum heap sizes in bytes, with `{product}` denoting they are product-level settings (default and stable). Note that the exact values depend on your JVM version (e.g., Java 8, 11, 17) and platform (e.g., Linux x64, Windows).

For example, on a Linux system with Java 11, you might see `InitialHeapSize` as 256 MB, but on a Windows system with Java 8, it might differ. This variability underscores the importance of checking defaults for your specific setup, especially in cloud environments where resource constraints can affect performance.

#### Conclusion
By running `java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version`, users can view the default JVM configuration, crucial for diagnosing issues like memory errors and optimizing performance in GCP. This method is supported by reliable sources like TheServerSide.com and Oracle’s documentation, ensuring accuracy. For further details, consult [Oracle’s JVM Options page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/vmoptions-jsp.html) for a list of flags and their defaults, though the command provides a practical, all-in-one solution. This approach is particularly relevant for troubleshooting Tomcat on GCP, aligning with the earlier discussion on heap size adjustments and memory management.
