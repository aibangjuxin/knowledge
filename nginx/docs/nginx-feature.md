NGINX Gateway Fabric
NGINX Gateway Fabric is an open-source project that provides an implementation of the Gateway API using NGINX as the data plane. The goal of this project is to implement the core Gateway APIs -- Gateway, GatewayClass, HTTPRoute, GRPCRoute, TCPRoute, TLSRoute, and UDPRoute -- to configure an HTTP or TCP/UDP load balancer, reverse-proxy, or API gateway for applications running on Kubernetes.

For a list of supported Gateway API resources and features, see the Gateway API Compatibility doc.
