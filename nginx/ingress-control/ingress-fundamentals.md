Nginx Ingress Controller fundamentals:

What is Ingress Controller:

1. Kubernetes doesnâ€™t expose apps to internet by default
2. LoadBalancer service costs money for each service
3. Ingress Controller is single entry point for all your apps
4. Routes external traffic to internal services based on rules
5. Think of it as reverse proxy for your Kubernetes cluster

Why Nginx Ingress Controller:

1. Most popular and battle-tested solution
2. Free and open source
3. Handles SSL/TLS termination automatically
4. Load balances traffic across pods
5. Path-based and host-based routing

How it works:

1. Deploy Nginx Ingress Controller in your cluster
2. Creates LoadBalancer service (one IP for everything)
3. Create Ingress resources with routing rules
4. Controller reads Ingress rules and configures Nginx
5. Routes traffic based on paths and hostnames to services

Common use cases:

1. Host multiple apps on single IP address
2. SSL certificates management with cert-manager
3. Path-based routing to different services
4. Hostname-based routing to different backends

One controller, unlimited apps. Save money and simplify infrastructure.
