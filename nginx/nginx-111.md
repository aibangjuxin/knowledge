So, the user's question is about a problem in their GCP (Google Cloud Platform) project. They have a request flow where user requests go to component A, which is a layer 7 NGINX, and then to component B, which is a GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) Runtime Service. Sometimes, they get an error: "failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream" on the layer 7 side, but the GKE Runtime seems to be normal and hasn't received any requests.
They want to know the possible causes of this issue.
Alright, first, I need to understand what this error means. "Failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream" sounds like a network connection problem. In the context of NGINX, "upstream" refers to the backend servers that NGINX is trying to connect to. So, in this case, the upstream is the GKE Runtime Service.
So, the error is happening when NGINX is trying to connect to the GKE Runtime Service, and it's getting a connection refused error. That means that when NGINX attempts to establish a connection to the GKE Runtime Service, the connection is being refused.
But the user also says that the GKE Runtime hasn't received any requests, and its status is normal. So, the GKE Runtime Service is up and running, but for some reason, NGINX can't connect to it.
Hmm, that's confusing. If the GKE Runtime is normal and not receiving any requests, but NGINX is trying to connect and getting a connection refused, maybe there's some issue with the connection between NGINX and GKE Runtime.
Let me think about the possible reasons for a connection refused error.
First, connection refused typically means that the server (in this case, GKE Runtime Service) is not listening on the port that NGINX is trying to connect to, or there's some network issue preventing the connection from being established.
But the user says that the GKE Runtime is normal, so it should be listening on the expected port.
Wait, maybe the GKE Runtime Service is not accessible from NGINX's perspective. Maybe there's a network connectivity issue between them.
In GCP, both components are likely in the same project, but they might be in different networks or have some firewall rules blocking the connection.
Let me recall: GKE is a managed container platform, and NGINX is likely running in some kind of VM or another container.
Wait, the user says "A(7 layer NGINX)", which is probably a load balancer or a reverse proxy, and "B(GKE RT) SVC", which is a service in GKE.In GKE, services are exposed through IPs or DNS names within the cluster.
So, NGINX is probably trying to connect to the GKE service via its IP or DNS name.
But if the GKE Runtime Service is normal, meaning the pods are running and the service is up, why is NGINX getting a connection refused?
Maybe the issue is with the way NGINX is configured to connect to the GKE service.
Let me check what "upstream" means in NGINX.
In NGINX, "upstream" is a module that allows you to define groups of servers that can be treated as a single unit. When you define an upstream block, you specify the servers that are part of that group, and then in your server blocks, you can proxy requests to that upstream group.
So, in this case, NGINX has an upstream defined that points to the GKE Runtime Service.
The error "failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream" suggests that when NGINX tries to connect to one of the servers in the upstream group, it gets a connection refused.
But the user says that the GKE Runtime hasn't received any requests. So, perhaps the connection is not reaching the GKE Runtime at all.
Wait, that's confusing. If NGINX is trying to connect to the GKE Runtime Service and getting a connection refused, that means it's trying to establish a connection, but the connection is being refused before any request is sent.
So, the GKE Runtime Service might not be accepting connections from NGINX's IP address, or there might be some port mismatch.
 
Let me think about possible causes:
Network Connectivity Issue: There might be a network issue between the NGINX server and the GKE cluster. Maybe some firewall rule is blocking the traffic, or there's a routing issue.
Port Mismatch: NGINX is trying to connect to a specific port, but the GKE Runtime Service is listening on a different port.
Service Unavailability: Even though the GKE Runtime Service is reported as normal, maybe some of its pods are down or not ready to accept connections.
Configuration Error in NGINX: The upstream configuration in NGINX might be incorrect. Maybe the IP address or the port specified is wrong.
DNS Resolution Issue: If NGINX is using a DNS name to connect to the GKE service, there might be a DNS resolution issue, leading to connecting to the wrong IP or no IP at all.
Security Settings: Maybe there are some security settings or authentication requirements that NGINX is not meeting, causing the connection to be refused.
Load Balancer Issues: If there's a load balancer in front of the GKE service, maybe it's not forwarding the traffic correctly.
Wait, but the user mentioned that the flow is user request -> A (NGINX) -> B (GKE RT SVC). So, NGINX is directly connecting to the GKE Runtime Service, without any intermediate load balancer mentioned.
But in GKE, services are typically exposed through a cluster IP, and if you want external access, you might need a load balancer or a node port.
Wait a minute, is NGINX running inside the GKE cluster or outside?
The user says "A(7 layer NGINX)", and "B(GKE RT) SVC". It's not clear if A is inside or outside the GKE cluster.
In GKE, you can have NGINX running as a pod or as a separate VM.
If NGINX is running inside the GKE cluster, then connecting to the GKE service should be straightforward, as they are in the same network.
But if NGINX is running outside the GKE cluster, then there might be network connectivity issues.
Let me assume that NGINX is running outside the GKE cluster, as it's labeled as "7 layer NGINX", which might be a separate component.
So, if NGINX is outside the GKE cluster, it needs to connect to the GKE service's IP address.
In GKE, to expose a service to external traffic, you typically use a LoadBalancer type service, which provisions an external IP address.
So, perhaps the GKE Runtime Service is a LoadBalancer service, and NGINX is trying to connect to that external IP.
But the user says that the GKE Runtime hasn't received any requests, which is confusing because if NGINX is connecting to the external IP, the GKE service should receive the requests.
Wait, but the error is "failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream", which happens when NGINX is trying to connect to the upstream server, but the connection is refused.
So, in this case, NGINX is trying to establish a connection to the GKE service, but the connection is being refused.
But if the GKE service is normal, meaning its pods are running and the service is up, why is the connection being refused?
Maybe the issue is that the GKE service is not accepting connections from the IP address of NGINX.
In GKE, you can set firewall rules to allow traffic from specific IP addresses.
So, perhaps the firewall rule for the GKE service is not allowing traffic from NGINX's IP address.
That could be a possible cause.
Another possibility is that the GKE service is configured to only accept traffic from within the cluster, and since NGINX is outside, it's being refused.
Wait, but if it's a LoadBalancer service, it's meant to accept external traffic.
So, that might not be the case.
Let me double-check how services work in GKE.
In GKE, a Service of type LoadBalancer exposes the service on an external IP address, and it's accessible from outside the cluster.
So, if NGINX is trying to connect to that external IP, it should be able to connect, provided that the service is configured correctly and the firewall allows the traffic.
But the user says that the GKE Runtime hasn't received any requests. So, perhaps the connection is not reaching the service at all.
Wait, maybe the issue is with the way NGINX is configured to connect to the GKE service.
In NGINX, when you define an upstream, you specify the server's IP and port.
So, if the upstream is defined with the correct IP and port of the GKE service, and the GKE service is listening on that port, it should work.
But perhaps the port is not correct.
Wait, maybe the GKE service is exposed on a certain port, but NGINX is trying to connect to a different port.
For example, if the GKE service is exposed on port 80, but NGINX is trying to connect to port 443, that would cause a connection refused if nothing is listening on port 443.
So, port mismatch could be a possibility.
Another thing to consider is that the GKE service might be using HTTPS, and NGINX is trying to connect via HTTP, or vice versa.
But the error is about connection refused, which is more about the TCP connection level, not about the HTTP protocol.
So, it's a lower-level issue.
Let me see if there's any documentation or common troubleshooting steps for this error in NGINX.
I think I should perform a web search to find out more about this specific error message in NGINX.
So, my first action would be to search the web for "failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream NGINX".
Wait, but the user's question is in Chinese, and the error message is in English, so I need to make sure that the search query is correct.
Wait, no, the error message is "failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream", which is standard NGINX error message.
So, I can search for that.
But before that, maybe I can recall what error code 111 means.
I think in Unix, error code 111 is ECONNREFUSED, which means connection refused.
So, it's a standard error when trying to connect to a socket that's not accepting connections.
So, that doesn't give me much new information.
Let me think about the possible causes again.
Another possibility is that the GKE service is not ready or is in a state where it's not accepting connections, even though it's reported as normal.
Maybe there's a delay in the service becoming fully operational, or some pods are not ready.
But the user says that the GKE Runtime is normal, so maybe that's not the case.
Wait, perhaps the service is up, but individual pods are not ready, and the load balancer is trying to connect to a pod that's not ready.
But in that case, the load balancer should retry or connect to another pod.
Wait, but NGINX is connecting directly to the GKE service's external IP, which is a load balancer, so the load balancer should handle the connection and distribute it to the backend pods.
So, if the load balancer is up, it should accept the connection and then forward it to the backend.
But if the load balancer itself is not accepting connections, that would cause the connection refused error.
Wait, maybe the issue is with the load balancer.


以下是可能导致“failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream”错误的几个关键点：
GKE Runtime Service可能未正确对外暴露，NGINX无法连接。
NGINX的配置可能错误，连接的IP或端口不对。
网络连接问题或防火墙规则可能阻止了NGINX到GKE服务的连接。
GKE服务偶尔可能不接受连接，尽管状态显示正常。
背景说明
您的请求流程是：用户请求 → A（7层NGINX，负责API路由和HTTP头部处理） → B（GKE Runtime Service，作为最终服务运行时）。问题出现在NGINX尝试连接GKE服务时，偶尔出现连接被拒绝的错误，但GKE服务未收到任何请求，且其状态正常。
可能原因分析
服务暴露问题  
如果GKE Runtime Service是ClusterIP类型，仅在集群内部可访问，而NGINX在集群外，则会连接失败。需要确保服务类型为LoadBalancer或NodePort以支持外部访问。
例如，如果是LoadBalancer，确保NGINX连接的是外部IP，而不是内部ClusterIP。
NGINX配置错误  
检查NGINX的upstream配置，确保指向GKE服务的正确IP和端口。如果配置了ClusterIP但NGINX在集群外，会导致连接被拒绝。
网络和防火墙问题  
可能存在防火墙规则或网络策略阻止NGINX到GKE服务的流量。检查VPC网络设置，确保相关端口开放，且NGINX的IP被允许访问。
临时性服务问题  
GKE服务的Pods可能偶尔未准备好接受连接，导致连接被拒绝，尽管服务状态显示正常。检查Pods的就绪状态和健康检查。
令人惊讶的细节
令人惊讶的是，尽管GKE服务状态正常，但NGINX完全无法连接，说明问题可能出在网络层或服务暴露配置上，而不是服务本身。
调查笔记
本文详细分析了在GCP工程中，请求流程为用户请求 → A（7层NGINX） → B（GKE Runtime Service）时，偶尔出现“failed (111: connection refused) while connecting to upstream”错误的情况。NGINX负责API路由和HTTP头部处理，GKE Runtime Service作为最终服务运行时，但GKE服务未收到任何请求，且状态正常。以下是详细的可能原因和排查步骤。
问题背景
用户的请求流程明确为：
用户请求首先到达A组件，即7层NGINX，负责API路由和HTTP头部处理。
然后流量转发到B组件，即GKE Runtime Service（简称GKE RT SVC），作为最终服务运行时。
问题表现为NGINX在连接上游（GKE RT SVC）时，偶尔出现连接被拒绝（错误码111），但GKE服务未收到任何请求，且其状态显示正常。
错误码111（ECONNREFUSED）是标准的TCP连接被拒绝错误，表明目标服务器未在指定端口上接受连接。这提示问题可能出在网络连接、配置或服务暴露上。
可能原因分析
以下是详细的可能原因，基于NGINX和GKE的特性以及网络配置：
GKE Runtime Service未正确对外暴露
分析：在GKE中，服务的暴露方式有多种，包括ClusterIP、NodePort和LoadBalancer。ClusterIP仅在集群内部可访问，如果NGINX运行在集群外（如在VM上），尝试连接ClusterIP会失败。
细节：如果服务类型为ClusterIP，IP地址仅在集群内部路由，外部访问会返回连接被拒绝。需要确保服务类型为LoadBalancer（提供外部IP）或NodePort（通过节点IP和端口暴露）。
支持证据：根据Exposing applications using services | Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) | Google Cloud，LoadBalancer服务会分配外部IP，NodePort服务通过节点IP暴露，ClusterIP仅限内部访问。
NGINX upstream配置错误
分析：NGINX通过upstream模块定义后端服务器。如果upstream配置了错误的IP（例如ClusterIP）或端口，连接会失败。
细节：例如，如果GKE服务是LoadBalancer类型，但NGINX配置连接的是ClusterIP，或者端口号不匹配（如GKE服务监听80端口，但NGINX尝试连接443端口），会导致连接被拒绝。
支持证据：从nginx-ingress connection refused issues，类似问题中提到配置错误会导致连接失败。
网络连接或防火墙问题
分析：可能存在VPC网络策略、防火墙规则或Google Cloud的访问控制列表（ACL）阻止NGINX到GKE服务的流量。
细节：例如，GKE服务的LoadBalancer可能仅允许特定IP范围访问，如果NGINX的IP不在允许范围内，会被拒绝。或者，节点防火墙未开放相关端口。
支持证据：从Customize your network isolation in GKE | GKE networking | Google Cloud，GKE支持设置授权网络，限制外部访问。
GKE服务临时性不可用
分析：尽管GKE服务状态显示正常，但其Pods可能偶尔未准备好接受连接，例如健康检查失败或Pods正在重启。
细节：GKE服务的就绪探针（readiness probe）或存活探针（liveness probe）可能导致部分时间不可用，LoadBalancer可能在这种情况下拒绝新连接。
支持证据：从Troubleshoot load balancing in GKE | GKE networking | Google Cloud，提到Pods终止时可能导致502/503错误，类似问题可能引发连接被拒绝。
LoadBalancer配置问题
分析：如果GKE服务使用LoadBalancer类型，LoadBalancer可能配置为内部负载均衡器，仅在同一VPC内可用，而NGINX尝试从外部连接。
细节：内部LoadBalancer无法从VPC外部访问，如果NGINX在不同网络，连接会被拒绝。需要确保LoadBalancer是外部类型，并检查其健康检查状态。
支持证据：从GKE Load Balancer Connection Refused - Stack Overflow，提到内部LoadBalancer导致外部连接失败。
排查步骤
为了定位问题，建议按以下步骤进行：
检查GKE服务类型：
使用kubectl get svc查看GKE Runtime Service的类型。如果是ClusterIP，且NGINX在集群外，需改为LoadBalancer或NodePort。
如果是LoadBalancer，记录其EXTERNAL-IP，确保NGINX配置连接此IP。
验证NGINX upstream配置：
检查NGINX配置文件中的upstream块，确保IP和端口与GKE服务匹配。例如：
upstream gke-service {
    server <EXTERNAL-IP>:80;
}
测试从NGINX所在机器直接telnet或curl GKE服务的IP和端口，确认是否能连接。
检查网络和防火墙：
在GCP控制台检查VPC网络的防火墙规则，确保从NGINX的IP到GKE服务IP的流量被允许。
检查GKE集群的授权网络设置，确认NGINX的IP在允许范围内。
监控GKE服务状态：
使用kubectl describe svc <service-name>和kubectl get pods -l <selector>查看服务和Pods的状态，确保Pods就绪。
检查Pods的日志，确认是否有连接被拒绝的迹象。
分析间歇性问题：
由于问题偶尔出现，可能与Pods的自动扩展或健康检查相关。启用GKE的日志和监控，观察错误发生时的服务状态。
总结与建议
综合以上分析，问题最可能的原因是GKE Runtime Service未正确对外暴露（如ClusterIP类型）或NGINX配置错误。建议首先确认服务类型和NGINX upstream配置，然后检查网络和防火墙规则。如果问题仍存，可进一步监控服务状态，排查间歇性不可用。
以下是详细对比表，总结不同服务类型的访问方式：
服务类型
访问范围
外部访问方式
ClusterIP
仅集群内部
不可，需改为LoadBalancer/NodePort
NodePort
集群节点IP+静态端口
通过节点IP和端口访问
LoadBalancer
外部IP，公共或内部
连接EXTERNAL-IP，需确保外部访问
通过以上步骤，应能有效定位并解决连接被拒绝的问题。
