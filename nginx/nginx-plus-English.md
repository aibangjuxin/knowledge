## Executive Summary

This report aims to provide users currently utilizing NGINX Open Source on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instances for Layer 4 (L4) and Layer 7 (L7) traffic—including location and path-based distribution, and client certificate Common Name (CN) validation—with a comprehensive assessment of upgrading to F5 NGINX Plus. The core of this evaluation lies in whether the benefits offered by NGINX Plus in terms of advanced security, operational efficiency, enhanced monitoring, and dynamic control can outweigh its licensing costs and migration efforts. For the user's specific L4/L7 application scenarios and CN validation requirements, NGINX Plus offers more mature and powerful built-in functionalities designed to reduce operational complexity and enhance overall system performance and reliability. The key decision point hinges on the user's tolerance for the operational overhead associated with implementing advanced features in NGINX Open Source versus the streamlined, supported, and more robust capabilities offered by NGINX Plus. Overall, if the user seeks more advanced dynamic control, finer-grained security policies, and comprehensive enterprise-grade support, upgrading to NGINX Plus would be a strategically sound choice.

## 1. Introduction

The user's current infrastructure relies on the NGINX Open Source version deployed on GCP Compute Engine instances. This deployment is responsible for handling L4 and L7 network traffic, with core functionalities including request distribution to backend services based on `Location` and `path`, as well as performing CN validation of client certificates. The purpose of this report is to provide a professional assessment, detailing a comparison between NGINX Open Source and F5 NGINX Plus, analyzing the necessity and potential impacts of an upgrade, and emphasizing specific functional enhancements in NGINX Plus relevant to the user's current L4/L7 applications (particularly CN validation and advanced routing) and GCP environment. The user's current investment in NGINX Open Source, especially in CN validation applications, indicates a certain level of technical capability but also suggests they might be encountering the inherent limitations of the open-source version in advanced scenarios—limitations that NGINX Plus is designed to address.

## 2. NGINX Open Source vs. F5 NGINX Plus: Comparative Analysis

This section aims to provide a foundational explanation of the core differences between NGINX Open Source and F5 NGINX Plus, laying the groundwork for more targeted recommendations later.

### 2.1. Core Load Balancing & Proxy (Layer 4 & Layer 7)

Both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus offer robust L4 (TCP/UDP) and L7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancing and reverse proxy capabilities.1 NGINX Open Source supports basic load balancing algorithms such as Round Robin, IP Hash, and Least Connections.3 NGINX Plus expands on this by providing more advanced algorithms, including Least Time and Random with Two Choices (which picks two random servers and then chooses based on least connections), enabling finer-grained traffic distribution control in complex scenarios.4 Both can achieve basic CN validation through SSL module directives.

While the open-source version is powerful, NGINX Plus's advanced algorithms like Least Time can offer superior performance and resource utilization when dealing with application environments that have varying request complexities or are latency-sensitive. This is because the "Least Time" algorithm directly factors in server responsiveness, a more intelligent metric than connection count alone. The user's services might have diverse response times, where traditional Round Robin or Least Connections could inadvertently overload a temporarily slow fast server or send traffic to slower ones. The Least Time algorithm in NGINX Plus 4 makes more informed routing decisions by directly measuring server latency, potentially improving overall application performance and user experience.

### 2.2. Session Persistence Mechanisms

NGINX Open Source primarily offers basic session persistence through the IP Hash method.3 NGINX Plus significantly enhances this with "sticky cookie" (NGINX Plus adds a cookie to identify the server), "sticky route" (uses routing information from a cookie or URI), and the more advanced "sticky learn" method (server-side session learning without client-side cookies, and supports state sharing in a cluster).4

For applications requiring robust and flexible session persistence, especially in clustered environments, NGINX Plus provides superior solutions. The "sticky learn" method is particularly powerful as it reduces dependency on client-side state and allows session synchronization across an NGINX Plus cluster 4, which is crucial for HA and scalability. IP Hash in the open-source version, while simple, can lead to uneven distribution if a server goes down or the backend pool changes. Sticky cookie is an improvement but relies on client-side cookies. Sticky learn 4 moves the state to a server-side shared memory zone, making it more robust and transparent to the client. The `sync` parameter for the `sticky learn` zone 4 means session state can be replicated across NGINX Plus cluster instances, ensuring session continuity even if one NGINX Plus node fails and traffic is routed to another. This is a significant advantage for stateful applications.

### 2.3. Backend Server Health Monitoring (Passive vs. Active Health Checks)

NGINX Open Source relies on passive health checks: if a connection to an upstream server fails or times out, NGINX marks it as unavailable for a period.3 NGINX Plus introduces active health checks, where NGINX Plus proactively sends out-of-band health check requests to upstream servers and assesses their status based on the response.1 This allows NGINX Plus to detect failed servers more quickly and to gracefully reintroduce recovered servers (e.g., with the slow-start feature 3).

Active health checks in NGINX Plus lead to higher application availability and faster recovery from backend failures compared to passive checks alone. Proactive monitoring means NGINX Plus can stop sending traffic to a failed server _before_ users experience errors, rather than reacting after errors occur. Passive checks only detect a problem when a real user request fails, meaning some users will experience errors before NGINX Open Source marks a server down. NGINX Plus's active health checks 1 run independently, probing servers and marking them unhealthy based on configurable conditions (e.g., specific status codes, response body content 5). This proactive approach minimizes user impact. The "slow-start" feature 3 further improves this by gradually reintroducing a recovered server, preventing it from being overwhelmed by a sudden influx of traffic.

### 2.4. Observability: Metrics, Logs & Live Activity Monitoring

NGINX Open Source provides basic metrics via the `stub_status` module 8 and standard access/error logs.9NGINX Plus significantly expands observability with over 100-150 additional metrics 1, a built-in live activity monitoring dashboard, and a JSON-based API for these metrics.10 NGINX Plus also supports native OpenTelemetry tracing.1

The rich observability in NGINX Plus greatly improves troubleshooting, performance tuning, and capacity planning. The live dashboard offers instant insights, while the API and OpenTelemetry support facilitate integration with modern monitoring stacks, crucial for complex, dynamic environments like GCP. The `stub_status` 8 in open source provides only a handful of metrics, which is often insufficient for deep performance analysis or rapid troubleshooting in production. NGINX Plus's extended metrics 1 (covering upstreams, caches, server zones, worker processes, etc.) offer a much more granular view. The live activity monitoring dashboard 11 allows operators to see real-time traffic patterns, server health, and potential bottlenecks without complex external tool setup. Accessing these metrics via an API 11 is critical for integration with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Google Cloud Monitoring, enabling automated alerting and historical trend analysis. Native OpenTelemetry support 1 simplifies the implementation of distributed tracing.

### 2.5. Configuration Management: Static Files vs. Dynamic API

NGINX Open Source relies on static configuration files. Changes typically require a configuration reload (`nginx -s reload`), which, while graceful, can have a minor impact on long-lived connections in very high-traffic scenarios if not handled carefully. NGINX Plus introduces a RESTful API for dynamically reconfiguring certain parameters, notably upstream server groups (adding/removing servers, changing weights, marking down/up) and key-value stores, without a process reload.1

The NGINX Plus API enables more agile and automated operations, especially in cloud environments like GCP where autoscaling or frequent backend changes are common. Avoiding reloads for upstream changes reduces operational friction and potential minor disruptions. In dynamic environments (e.g., GCP instance groups autoscaling), updating NGINX Open Source backends means editing config files and reloading NGINX. This can be automated but adds complexity. The NGINX Plus API 13 allows these changes to be made programmatically (e.g., via `curl` or orchestration tools) on the fly. This is crucial for seamless autoscaling integration, blue-green deployments, or A/B testing where backend pools change frequently. Persistence via a state file 14 ensures these dynamic changes survive NGINX restarts/reloads if the main configuration file itself has not changed the upstream block definition.

### 2.6. High Availability (HA) Architecture

NGINX Open Source can be set up in HA configurations using external tools like `keepalived`.7 NGINX Plus enhances HA capabilities by providing official support and integration for such setups, including active-active and active-passive modes with `keepalived`.1 Crucially, NGINX Plus offers in-cluster configuration synchronization (using the `nginx-sync` script) and run-time state sharing (for features like sticky-learn session persistence, rate limiting, and key-value stores).1

NGINX Plus offers a more integrated and robust HA solution. Configuration synchronization and run-time state sharing are significant differentiators that reduce manual effort, ensure consistency, and enable more seamless failover in clustered deployments. While `keepalived` provides IP failover for both open source and Plus, managing configuration consistency between HA nodes in open source is a manual or custom-scripted task. NGINX Plus's `nginx-sync` script 19 automates this, reducing errors. More importantly, features like sticky-learn session persistence 4 or shared rate limits can only be truly effective in an HA setup if their state is shared or synchronized across NGINX Plus cluster nodes.1 This ensures that if a failover occurs, the new active NGINX Plus node has the necessary session/rate-limit information to continue processing traffic consistently, which is not easily achievable with open source.

### 2.7. Security Capabilities (Baseline vs. Enterprise-Grade)

NGINX Open Source provides foundational security features like SSL/TLS termination, IP-based access control, and basic rate limiting. NGINX Plus enhances security with native JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication support 5, advanced rate-limiting capabilities (with state sharing), and seamless integration with NGINX App Protect WAF (providing comprehensive L7 protection against OWASP Top 10 and other threats).5

NGINX Plus is positioned as a more comprehensive security solution at the edge, especially for API security (JWT) and application protection (WAF). This aligns with the trend of shifting security left and integrating security controls directly into the application delivery infrastructure. While open source can handle TLS, more advanced authentication mechanisms like JWT require custom solutions (e.g., Lua scripting or external auth services). NGINX Plus's native JWT validation 21 simplifies API security. A WAF is a critical component for protecting web applications; NGINX App Protect 23 is F5's enterprise-grade WAF designed for tight integration with NGINX Plus, offering more advanced protection than, for example, ModSecurity with open source. This integrated approach can simplify the security stack.

### 2.8. Programmability & Extensibility (e.g., NGINX JavaScript, Key-Value Store)

NGINX Open Source can be extended via third-party modules (often requiring recompilation) and Lua scripting. NGINX Plus supports these but also introduces the NGINX JavaScript module (njs) for lightweight, powerful scripting directly within NGINX configurations 1, and an API-manageable dynamic Key-Value Store.1

njs and the Key-Value Store in NGINX Plus offer a significantly more powerful and flexible way to implement custom logic within NGINX, such as advanced CN validation or dynamic routing, often with better performance and easier management for certain tasks than Lua in the open-source version, and without recompilation. Lua, while powerful, can have performance implications if not implemented carefully.32 njs is designed as a more integrated and potentially more performant scripting solution for NGINX. The Key-Value Store 30, accessible via API and njs, allows dynamic data to influence NGINX behavior without configuration reloads. This is a powerful combination for implementing custom logic that responds to real-time conditions or external data sources, directly relevant to the user's needs for advanced CN validation and routing.

### 2.9. Support, Documentation & Enterprise Services

NGINX Open Source relies on community support and publicly available documentation. F5 NGINX Plus includes commercial-grade 24x7 support from NGINX engineers, managed releases, and access to enterprise services.5

For mission-critical deployments, enterprise support with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is a major factor. This reduces risk and provides expert assistance for complex configurations, troubleshooting, and security incidents. Community support for open source, while valuable, offers no guarantees on response time or issue resolution. For businesses relying on NGINX for critical applications, the assurance of professional support 7 can be a deciding factor. This is especially true when dealing with advanced features or complex integrations in environments like GCP.

## 3. Key NGINX Plus Advantages Relevant to Your Current Usage

This section will focus on the features within NGINX Plus that directly address the user's needs regarding CN validation, advanced routing, and other highly relevant enterprise-grade functionalities.

### 3.1. Advanced Client Certificate (CN) Validation & Handling

NGINX Open Source typically uses the `ssl_verify_client on` directive to enable client certificate validation, combined with the `map` directive to match the `$ssl_client_s_dn` or `$ssl_client_s_dn_cn` variable against a list of allowed CNs. This approach becomes cumbersome when dealing with a large number of CNs or when logic beyond simple string matching is required.

NGINX Plus offers a far more flexible and powerful solution with **NGINX JavaScript (njs)**.27 njs can access the raw client certificate (as shown in an njs-example accessing `r.variables.ssl_client_raw_cert` for Subject Alternative Names 29), allowing parsing of any field within the certificate, not just the CN. Complex logic can be implemented in JavaScript to validate specific Organizational Units (OUs), issuers, or custom extensions within the certificate, or even perform lookups against external systems. The recipe on "Advanced Client-Side Encryption" (7.4) in the _NGINX Cookbook, 3rd Edition_ 34 likely covers such scenarios.

Furthermore, the **Key-Value Store** in NGINX Plus 30 can be used to dynamically manage CN-to-attribute mappings (e.g., CN to user role, CN to allowed backend service). njs can then query this key-value store using the CN (or parts of it) as a key. Importantly, the key-value store can be updated via the NGINX Plus API without reloading the NGINX configuration 30, allowing for dynamic updates to CN-based access policies. The _NGINX Cookbook_ 34 also includes content on "Using the Key-Value Store with NGINX Plus" (5.2).

For complex CN validation needs (e.g., mapping CNs to specific permissions, checking multiple certificate attributes, dynamic allow/deny lists), njs and the Key-Value Store in NGINX Plus provide a significantly more robust, manageable, and dynamic solution than the open-source version. This transforms CN validation from a static configuration challenge into a programmable, API-driven security feature. The user's current "CN validation" might be simple now, but if it needs to scale or become more granular (e.g., different access levels based on CN patterns or other certificate fields), the open-source `map` directive becomes unwieldy. njs allows parsing the full certificate 29, meaning issuer, validity, specific OUs, etc., can be checked, not just the CN string. The Key-Value Store 30 can then be used to map these validated identities to specific policies (e.g., which upstream to route to, what rate limits to apply). This mapping can be updated dynamically via API, perhaps from an external identity management system, without an NGINX reload. This is a huge operational advantage for managing client certificate-based access control at scale. Details like client certificate CN or fingerprint can also be logged to access logs for auditing and troubleshooting.35

### 3.2. Enhanced Location and Path Routing

NGINX Open Source provides powerful `location` matching capabilities through prefix strings and regular expressions.36 However, when highly dynamic or complex conditional routing based on a combination of request attributes (headers, cookies, query parameters, client IP, CN validation result, etc.) is needed, it can lead to very complex and nested `location` blocks or heavy reliance on `map` and `if` directives (which have limitations).

NGINX Plus enhances this capability through:

- **njs (NGINX JavaScript):** Allows for imperative routing logic to be implemented. Scripts can inspect various request attributes (headers, body, variables like `$ssl_client_s_dn_cn`) and programmatically decide on the upstream server or modify the request before proxying.27 An example of njs dynamically selecting an upstream in the stream module based on protocol detection illustrates the principle.29 The "Using the njs Module..." (5.3) recipe in the _NGINX Cookbook_ 34 is relevant here.
- **Key-Value Store:** Can store routing rules or backend mappings that can be dynamically queried by njs or other directives.30 For instance, one could map paths or customer IDs (derived from cookies, JWT claims, or even CNs) to specific upstream groups. 31 demonstrates dynamic bandwidth limiting based on a cookie value looked up in the KV store; similar logic applies to routing.
- **NGINX Plus API for Upstream Management:** While not directly path routing, the ability to dynamically change members in an upstream group 13 means that even if path routing logic points to a named upstream, the actual servers in that group can be changed on the fly, affecting where traffic for that path ultimately goes.

NGINX Plus allows for more sophisticated and dynamic request routing logic that can adapt to real-time conditions or external data without complex configuration reloads. This is crucial for microservices, A/B testing, canary releases, and personalized content delivery based on multiple factors, including the validated client identity (CN). The user's current "Location and path distribution" is likely handled by standard NGINX `location` blocks. If they need, for example, to route users with a specific CN pattern, from a particular IP range, accessing a specific path, to a different backend than normal users, this becomes very complex in open source. With njs in NGINX Plus, a script could evaluate `$ssl_client_s_dn_cn`, `$remote_addr`, and `$request_uri`, then programmatically set the `$proxy_pass` variable or select an upstream. The Key-Value Store could hold these mappings (e.g., {CN_pattern + IP_range + Path -> Upstream_X}), and these mappings could be updated via API. This makes the routing logic more maintainable and adaptable than deeply nested, regex-heavy `location` blocks.

### 3.3. Active Health Checks

As discussed in section 2.3, NGINX Plus provides active health check capabilities.1 These checks proactively monitor upstream servers by sending synthetic requests and evaluating responses against configurable criteria (e.g., status codes, response body content 4). This allows NGINX Plus to quickly identify and isolate failing servers, rerouting traffic to healthy instances. The "slow-start" feature 4 ensures that recovered servers are gradually reintroduced into the load-balancing pool, preventing them from being overwhelmed by a sudden influx of traffic.

For the user's services, active health checks mean significantly improved reliability and reduced user-facing errors. If a backend service, even one selected via CN validation or path routing, becomes unhealthy, NGINX Plus will proactively detect this and stop sending traffic to it, whereas the open-source version would wait for actual requests to fail. If one of the user's backend services becomes unresponsive or starts returning errors, NGINX Open Source with only passive checks will continue sending some user requests to it until `max_fails` is reached. This will result in errors for those users. NGINX Plus's active health checks 4would detect the issue independently of user traffic, mark the server down, and prevent users from being routed to it. This is a direct improvement in service availability.

### 3.4. Live Activity Monitoring Dashboard & API

NGINX Plus includes a built-in dashboard that displays a wide variety of metrics in real-time (connections, requests, server zones, upstreams, caches, worker processes, etc.).11 It also exposes these metrics via a JSON API, allowing integration with external monitoring systems.8 This provides far richer insight compared to the basic `stub_status` module of NGINX Open Source.

Enhanced monitoring capabilities lead to faster troubleshooting, improved capacity planning, and a clearer understanding of traffic patterns and application performance. For GCP deployments, these metrics can be fed into Google Cloud Monitoring for a unified view. Troubleshooting with NGINX Open Source often involves sifting through logs and relying on the limited `stub_status` metrics. The NGINX Plus dashboard 11provides an immediate, visual overview of key performance indicators. If users report a slow service, the dashboard can quickly show if a particular upstream is overloaded, error rates are high, or cache hit ratios are poor. The API 12 allows these detailed metrics to be scraped by tools like Prometheus or the Google Cloud Ops Agent, providing historical data and enabling alerting based on a much wider range of conditions than open-source metrics.

### 3.5. Dynamic Reconfiguration API

NGINX Plus allows on-the-fly changes to upstream server groups (adding/removing servers, modifying weights, health status) and key-value stores via a REST API, without a full NGINX reload.13 Changes can be persisted across reloads via a state file.14

This is a critical feature for dynamic environments like GCP, enabling seamless autoscaling of backend services, blue-green deployments, and A/B testing without service interruptions or manual configuration changes on NGINX instances. If the user's backend services on GCP are part of an autoscaling instance group, the NGINX Plus API 13 can be called by automation scripts when instances are added or removed. This keeps the NGINX upstream configuration synchronized with the actual backend pool in real-time, without requiring an NGINX reload. This is much cleaner and more reliable than scripting config file edits and reloads for NGINX Open Source.

### 3.6. Advanced Session Persistence Options (e.g., Sticky Learn)

In addition to basic IP Hash, NGINX Plus offers sticky cookie, sticky route, and server-side sticky learn methods.4 Sticky learn, in particular, can share session state across an NGINX Plus cluster, ensuring session integrity during failovers.1

For stateful applications distributed by NGINX, these advanced session persistence methods ensure users are consistently routed to the correct backend server, even in a clustered NGINX Plus setup, improving application correctness and user experience. If the user's application relies on session state stored on backend servers, ensuring a client always hits the same server is crucial. Sticky learn 4 is particularly advantageous as it doesn't rely on client-side cookies being enabled or perfectly preserved, and its ability to sync state in a cluster (4 `sync` parameter) means that even if one NGINX Plus instance fails, another can take over and still maintain correct session affinity using the shared state.

### 3.7. Robust High Availability Solutions (Active-Active, Config Sync)

NGINX Plus offers officially supported active-active and active-passive HA solutions based on `keepalived`.17A key NGINX Plus feature is configuration synchronization (`nginx-sync` script) to ensure consistency between HA nodes.18 Furthermore, run-time state sharing (for sticky learn, rate limiting, key-value store) enhances the robustness of HA clusters.18

Compared to relying on purely community-driven `keepalived` setups with NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus provides a more complete and manageable HA solution. Automated configuration sync and state sharing are significant operational advantages. Setting up HA with open source and `keepalived` is possible 15, but keeping configurations synchronized between nodes is a manual task or requires custom scripting, which is error-prone. The `nginx-sync` tool provided by NGINX Plus 19 automates this, ensuring consistency. State sharing for features like session persistence or rate limiting 18 means that in an active-active or active-passive setup, all nodes have a consistent view of this dynamic data, leading to more predictable behavior and seamless failovers.

### 3.8. Enterprise-Grade Security Features

- **Native JWT Authentication:** NGINX Plus can natively validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), simplifying the protection of APIs and microservices.16 This includes support for various JWS and JWE algorithms, key management via local files or remote JWKS URIs, and claim validation.
- **Integration with NGINX App Protect WAF:** For advanced application security, NGINX Plus integrates with F5's modern WAF offering, NGINX App Protect, providing protection against OWASP Top 10, zero-day attacks, bot mitigation, and more.16

NGINX Plus provides built-in tools and integrations to enhance the security posture, especially for API-driven services and protection against sophisticated web attacks, which would require significant custom work or third-party solutions with the open-source version. Securing APIs with JWT in open source often requires Lua scripting or routing to a separate authentication microservice. NGINX Plus's native JWT validation 21simplifies this architecture. Similarly, while ModSecurity can be used with open source as a WAF, NGINX App Protect 23 is F5's enterprise-grade WAF designed for NGINX, offering advanced features, regular signature updates, and commercial support, potentially providing more robust and manageable protection than open-source alternatives.

### 3.9. NGINX Plus Performance and Scalability Enhancements

While NGINX Open Source is already highly performant, NGINX Plus can offer further performance gains in specific scenarios. The architecture of NGINX Plus, such as its use of shared memory zones for upstream data (improving the accuracy of load balancing methods like least connections 3), and its ability to leverage kernel-bypass technologies like Solarflare Onload (37 showing up to 700% improvement in connections/sec in specific benchmarks, though Onload is a separate product), indicate a design focus on large-scale enterprise workloads.

For very demanding workloads, NGINX Plus's internal optimizations and compatibility with advanced networking technologies can translate to higher throughput, lower latency, and better resource utilization than the open-source version, especially when using features that benefit from shared state across worker processes. NGINX Open Source worker processes operate largely independently. NGINX Plus uses shared memory zones for upstream group data 3, health check status, sticky learn sessions 4, and rate limits, meaning all worker processes have a consistent view. This leads to more accurate load distribution (e.g., the least connections algorithm truly knows the global connection count to each upstream) and consistent policy application. While the Onload benchmark in 37 is specific to a third-party NIC and software, it demonstrates that NGINX Plus is engineered to take advantage of such acceleration technologies, hinting at its focus on extreme performance.

## 4. Upgrade Necessity and Benefit Assessment

This section will synthesize the preceding comparisons to directly assess whether an upgrade is worthwhile for the user.

### 4.1. Quantifiable and Qualitative Advantages for Your Operations

Upgrading to NGINX Plus can yield several significant advantages. Firstly, a reduction in downtime can be anticipated through active health checks 1 and more robust high-availability solutions.17 Secondly, native JWT support 21 and easier WAF integration 16 will enhance the security posture. In terms of operational efficiency, improvements will come from the dynamic configuration API 13, a more comprehensive monitoring system 11, and simplified management of complex CN validation/routing logic via njs and the Key-Value Store.29 Furthermore, enhanced metrics and the live dashboard facilitate faster troubleshooting.

The upgrade is not just an aggregation of individual features but a cumulative impact on operational stability, security, agility, and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), especially considering the human effort required to implement advanced functionalities in the open-source version. While NGINX Plus licensing is a direct cost, the "cost" of NGINX Open Source includes engineer-hours spent custom-developing advanced features, potential downtime from less mature HA or health check mechanisms, and time spent troubleshooting with limited metrics. NGINX Plus aims to reduce these indirect operational costs by providing these features out-of-the-box and supported.

### 4.2. Potential Drawbacks and Considerations

- **Licensing Costs:** This is the primary drawback. NGINX Plus is a commercial product and requires a subscription fee.38
- **Learning Curve:** Although NGINX Plus builds upon the open-source version, the team will still need to learn new features like the API, njs, and Key-Value Store.
- **Migration Effort:** While configurations are largely compatible, planning, testing, and executing the migration still require effort, especially if custom modules are in use.41
- **Dependency on F5 Ecosystem:** Adopting NGINX Plus means a closer tie to F5's product roadmap and support system.

Acknowledging these potential drawbacks is crucial for a credible report. Costs must be weighed against operational savings and risk reduction. The user needs to perform a cost-benefit analysis: are the current operational pain points or risks with the open-source solution significant enough that the NGINX Plus license cost is offset by savings in engineering time, reduced downtime, or improved security?

### 4.3. Is an Upgrade Justified? Mapping NGINX Plus Features to Current Pain Points and Future Needs

This subsection directly addresses the user, assessing based on their usage of CN validation and L4/L7 routing:

- If the current CN validation solution is complex, difficult to manage, or requires greater dynamism, NGINX Plus (via njs and Key-Value Store) offers significant improvements.
- If current `location` and `path` routing requires more dynamic inputs or complex conditional logic, NGINX Plus (via njs and Key-Value Store) excels.
- If backend stability is an issue and proactive failure detection is needed, active health checks in the Plus version are a strong driver.
- If there's a lack of real-time visibility and deeper metrics, the monitoring capabilities of Plus are a clear advantage.
- If upstream changes are frequent and reloads are becoming problematic, the Plus API will be beneficial.
- If there's a future need to scale out NGINX itself and maintain state consistency (sessions, rate limits, etc.), Plus HA with state sharing is important.

The justification for upgrading depends on the _gap_ between current capabilities/pain points and what NGINX Plus offers, specifically for the user's stated use cases. This is where the report becomes highly tailored. If their current CN validation is just a few static CNs in a `map`, the benefits of njs might seem like overkill, _unless_ they plan to expand this functionality. However, if they are already struggling with a large, complex `map`, or need to integrate with external identity systems for CNs, then Plus becomes very attractive. The same logic applies to routing complexity and other features. Future needs are as important as current pain points.

## 5. Migrating from NGINX Open Source to NGINX Plus on GCP

This section provides practical guidance on the migration process.

### 5.1. Installing NGINX Plus on GCP Compute Engine Instances

The migration process begins with obtaining an NGINX Plus subscription and the corresponding license files from the MyF5 portal, including `nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key` for accessing F5 software repositories, and `license.jwt` for instance activation.41 Before starting the installation, it is crucial to back up existing NGINX Open Source configuration and log files. The NGINX Plus installation process typically involves configuring the F5-provided software repository for your GCP instance's Linux distribution, then using the system's package manager (like `apt` or `yum`/`dnf`) to install the `nginx-plus` package. After installation, the downloaded `license.jwt` file needs to be placed in the `/etc/nginx/` directory.41 The GCP Marketplace also offers pre-built NGINX Plus VM images, which might simplify initial deployment steps.42

The installation process is not a simple `apt install nginx-plus`. It involves prerequisite steps like fetching license keys and certificates for the NGINX Plus software repository from the MyF5 portal 41, setting up that repository correctly, then installing the package, and finally deploying the `license.jwt` file. This is a multi-step process that needs to be followed carefully.

### 5.2. Configuration File Compatibility: Expectations for `nginx.conf` and Site Configs

NGINX Plus is a superset of NGINX Open Source. Core `nginx.conf` files and site-specific configuration files are generally compatible.41 This means the user's existing location and path-based distribution logic should work in NGINX Plus. However, any NGINX Plus-specific directives (e.g., `sticky learn`, `zone` directive in upstream blocks for API, `auth_jwt`) will only take effect after the upgrade. While most existing open-source configurations can be used directly, thorough testing after migration is highly recommended.

Basic proxying and `location` blocks should migrate smoothly. The migration effort will largely be in _enhancing_the existing configuration to leverage NGINX Plus features, rather than rewriting it from scratch. This smooth transition path allows users to first get NGINX Plus running with their existing (open-source compatible) configuration, and then incrementally introduce NGINX Plus-specific features like active health checks or the dynamic API. This phased approach can reduce migration risk.

### 5.3. Managing Existing Custom and Third-Party Modules

If the user's current NGINX Open Source is compiled with third-party modules, these modules will need to be recompiled against NGINX Plus's source code (or an open-source version compatible with that NGINX Plus release).41 It's worth noting that NGINX Plus itself provides many native features that might supersede the need for certain third-party modules. Additionally, F5 offers a range of NGINX Certified Modules that are tested and guaranteed to be compatible with NGINX Plus.41

Third-party modules are a potential point of complexity in migration. Recompilation requires a build environment and careful version matching. It's a worthwhile exercise to evaluate if NGINX Plus native features can replace these modules. If the user relies on specific third-party modules that do not have an NGINX Plus certified version, they must plan for recompilation.41 This adds time and risk to the migration. Alternatively, they should investigate if NGINX Plus itself offers the functionality of that module (e.g., advanced session persistence in Plus might make a third-party session module redundant).

### 5.4. NGINX Plus Licensing: Activation and Management (JWT-based)

Starting with NGINX Plus R33, licensing is based on a JSON Web Token (JWT) license file (`license.jwt`) obtained from the MyF5 portal.45 This file must be placed in the `/etc/nginx/` directory of each NGINX Plus instance. NGINX Plus instances are required to report usage data to F5's licensing endpoint, or via NGINX Instance Manager. If initial reporting fails, or if reporting is unsuccessful for an extended period (e.g., after a 180-day grace period), NGINX Plus may stop processing traffic.45

License management is an ongoing operational task. Ensuring connectivity for usage reporting (or using Instance Manager in isolated environments) is crucial for uninterrupted service. Unlike open source, NGINX Plus has a licensing mechanism that requires active participation. The JWT file 45 is key, but usage reporting is equally important.45 Users need to ensure their GCP instances can reach `product.connect.nginx.com` or plan for NGINX Instance Manager if they are in a restricted network. The 180-day grace period for reporting 45 provides some buffer, but it's not indefinite.

### 5.5. Assessing Migration Effort and Potential Costs (Software, Human Resources, Training)

Migrating to NGINX Plus involves several cost considerations:

- **Software Costs:** The subscription fee for NGINX Plus (see Section 7).
- **Human Resource Costs:** Time required for planning, installing NGINX Plus, migrating and testing existing configurations, recompiling any necessary third-party modules, configuring new features (e.g., API or njs scripts for CN validation), and integrating with GCP monitoring/logging systems.
- **Training Costs:** Team members may require training on NGINX Plus-specific features (like the API, njs, or NGINX App Protect WAF if adopted).
- **Long-term potential operational cost reductions** due to automation, better monitoring, and included support should also be factored in.

Migration is an investment. These costs need to be evaluated against the expected long-term benefits like operational efficiency, reliability, security, and scalability. The direct cost is the NGINX Plus license. Indirect costs include the engineering time for the migration itself. The effort involved will depend on the complexity of their current setup (especially third-party modules) and how many new NGINX Plus features they wish to implement immediately. Training might be needed if the team is unfamiliar with, for example, JavaScript for njs or the NGINX Plus API.

### Table 3: Estimated Migration Costs and Effort

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Cost/Effort Category**|**Description**|**Estimated Cost Range / Effort Level (Example)**|**Notes/Assumptions**|
|NGINX Plus Licensing|Annual subscription fee, potentially based on instance count or specific package|F5 Quote Required (e.g., $849-$2,099/month/instance, billed annually 38)|Depends on instance count, chosen package, and contract terms|
|Migration Human Effort|Config migration, testing, new feature implementation, documentation updates, etc.|Medium (e.g., 5-15 person-days, depending on complexity)|Assumes moderate scale and complexity of existing configuration|
|Training|Team members learning NGINX Plus new features (njs, API, App Protect, etc.)|Low to Medium (e.g., 0-5 person-days, depending on team's existing skills)|Can leverage official docs, online resources, or F5 training services|
|Third-Party Module Handling|Replacement or recompilation of existing custom modules (if applicable)|Low to High (depends on number and complexity of modules)|Strongly recommended to evaluate if native NGINX Plus features can replace|
|GCP Infrastructure Adjustments|E.g., configuring firewall rules for license reporting|Low (often negligible)|Ensure instances can reach F5 licensing endpoints|

## 6. Optimizing NGINX Plus in Google Cloud Platform Environment

This section focuses on maximizing the value of NGINX Plus within the user's GCP infrastructure.

### 6.1. Leveraging NGINX Plus on GCP Compute Engine

NGINX Plus runs as software on GCP Compute Engine instances, similar to the user's current NGINX Open Source setup. This provides flexibility in choosing instance types (CPU, memory) based on performance needs.46 Pre-built NGINX Plus VM images from the GCP Marketplace can simplify initial deployment.42

Users can continue to use their familiar GCP Compute Engine infrastructure but now with the enhanced capabilities of NGINX Plus and can optimize instance selection for NGINX Plus performance. The transition to NGINX Plus, if they stick with Compute Engine VMs, doesn't force a major change in their underlying GCP infrastructure management. They can leverage their existing GCP knowledge. GCP Marketplace offerings 42 might provide an easier starting point than manual installation on a bare OS image, potentially including some GCP-specific optimizations or easier billing integration.

### 6.2. NGINX Plus with Google Cloud Load Balancing (Architectural Considerations)

Users can deploy NGINX Plus instances behind a Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB), or use NGINX Plus as the primary load balancer.

- **NGINX Plus behind GCLB:** GCLB can handle global L4/L7 load balancing, SSL offload, and DDoS protection, while NGINX Plus instances provide advanced L7 features, WAF, session persistence, and fine-grained traffic management for backend services.47 This is a common "load balancer sandwich" pattern.34
- **NGINX Plus as Primary Load Balancer:** For regional deployments, or where GCLB features are not needed or are cost-prohibitive at certain tiers, NGINX Plus can act as the edge load balancer.
- GCP Network Load Balancer can be used to enable TCP connectivity to NGINX Plus instances, especially in active-active HA setups.43

NGINX Plus can complement GCLB by providing richer application-layer intelligence or serve as a standalone software load balancer, offering architectural choice based on specific needs and existing GCP investments. The user needs to decide on the architecture. Using GCLB at the edge leverages Google's global network, DDoS mitigation, and potentially simpler SSL certificate management via Google Certificate Manager. NGINX Plus instances can then sit behind GCLB to perform more advanced L7 tasks like complex routing, CN validation, WAF (App Protect), and advanced session persistence. This is a robust pattern.34Alternatively, if they don't need GCLB's global scale for a particular service, NGINX Plus itself can be the edge load balancer, potentially with its own HA setup (using `keepalived`) and a GCE Network Load Balancer for VIP management.43

### 6.3. Enhanced Integration with Google Cloud's Operations Suite (Monitoring, Logging)

NGINX Plus's extended metrics and JSON API 11 can be easily integrated with Google Cloud Monitoring. The Ops Agent can be configured to scrape NGINX Plus metrics (similar to how it scrapes NGINX Open Source metrics via `stub_status` or the NGINX Plus API endpoint 8). NGINX access and error logs 9 can be collected by the Ops Agent and sent to Google Cloud Logging for centralized analysis, alerting, and long-term storage. The more detailed metrics from NGINX Plus will provide richer data to Cloud Monitoring.

Leveraging the Ops Agent for NGINX Plus data provides seamless integration into the GCP observability ecosystem, offering a single pane of glass for metrics and logs alongside other GCP services. The richer metrics from NGINX Plus will enhance this view. The user is already on GCP, so using Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging is a natural fit. NGINX Plus's superior metrics 12 can be collected by configuring the Ops Agent 51 to hit the NGINX Plus API endpoint (e.g., `/api` 8). This provides much more detailed NGINX performance insight (connections, upstreams, cache, errors by status code, etc.) in Cloud Monitoring dashboards than `stub_status` from open source. Centralizing logs to Cloud Logging via the Ops Agent helps correlate NGINX activity with other application and GCP service logs. Pre-built dashboards and alerting policies for NGINX in Cloud Monitoring can be leveraged.51

### 6.4. Utilizing NGINX Plus Offerings from GCP Marketplace

F5 offers NGINX Plus and related solutions (like NGINX Ingress Controller with App Protect WAF 26) on the Google Cloud Marketplace. Deploying from the Marketplace can simplify the provisioning process, potentially offer integrated billing with GCP, and provide pre-configured VM images or Kubernetes applications.25 Support services are often included or easy to activate.42

GCP Marketplace offerings can streamline NGINX Plus adoption by handling some setup and potentially integrating licensing/billing with the user's existing GCP account. For users heavily invested in the GCP ecosystem, deploying NGINX Plus from the Marketplace 42 might be more convenient than manual installation on a bare image. It may come with an optimized base image, easier firewall rule setup during deployment, and unified billing through the GCP invoice. The NGINX Ingress Controller with App Protect WAF offering 26 also indicates more complex, bundled solutions are available. Users should check specific NGINX Plus VM offerings for details on pre-configuration and licensing terms.

## 7. NGINX Plus Licensing, Pricing, and Support

This section discusses the commercial aspects of NGINX Plus.

### 7.1. NGINX Plus Subscription Models and Tiers Overview

NGINX Plus is typically licensed via an annual subscription model.38 Licensing is often per-instance (60 for NGINX One; 45 notes license tied to subscription, not individual instances, but usage reporting implies per-instance tracking). Newer models like NGINX One bundle multiple NGINX products (Plus, Instance Manager, Ingress Controller) with per-instance or per-node pricing.61 F5 also offers Flexible Consumption Programs (FCP) for larger commitments.62 Starting with NGINX Plus R33 and later, each NGINX Plus instance requires a JWT license file for validation and usage reporting.45

Different tiers may exist (e.g., Application, Business Unit, Enterprise in older models 40; Standard V2 vs. Basic for NGINXaaS for Azure 64; Standard/Premium Support/App Protect editions for NGINX One 61).

NGINX's licensing has evolved. While per-instance subscription is common, bundled offerings (NGINX One) and consumption models (FCP, NGINXaaS NCUs) also exist. For on-prem/VM deployments, the core seems to be instance-based subscription with JWT license reporting. The various pricing models 38 indicate F5 is trying to cater to different customer needs (per-instance, bundled, consumption). For the user's GCP VM deployment, a per-instance subscription is the most likely model. If they anticipate needing Instance Manager or other NGINX products, the NGINX One offering 61 might be relevant. The key for their current setup is the JWT license per instance and the associated usage reporting.45

### 7.2. Estimated Costs for Your Potential Deployment Scenarios

Direct pricing is difficult to ascertain from existing snippets as many official pricing pages are inaccessible (65). 38 gives a range of $849 to $2,099 per month (billed annually) for different tiers (Team, Advanced). 39mentions NGINX Plus with App Protect on Azure Marketplace starting at $1.50/hour. Users will need to contact F5/NGINX sales or a reseller for a quote based on the number of GCP instances they plan to run NGINX Plus on.

Publicly available pricing is often indicative. Actual costs will depend on negotiation, volume, and the specific SKUs chosen. Pricing information is fragmented. The $849-$2099/month from 38 is a general figure from Trustradius. The Azure Marketplace hourly rate 39 is for a specific bundle and cloud provider. The user's GCP deployment will likely have its own pricing structure, most probably an annual subscription per instance. They _must_ get a direct quote.

### 7.3. Included Support Services and SLAs

NGINX Plus subscriptions typically include 24x7 enterprise-grade support from F5 NGINX engineers.7 SLAs for response times are often mentioned (e.g., 30-minute response for critical issues 40). NGINX One offers Standard and Premium support tiers.61 GCP Marketplace offerings also mention support services.42

Access to expert support with defined SLAs is one of the core value propositions of NGINX Plus, reducing risk for production issues and shortening resolution times. This is a key differentiator from the open-source version. If the user encounters a critical issue with NGINX Plus, they can contact F5 engineers directly and get a guaranteed response time.40 This is invaluable for production systems where downtime is costly. Support levels may vary by subscription tier (e.g., NGINX One Standard vs. Premium 61).

### Table 4: NGINX Plus Licensing Model Overview (Illustrative)

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Licensing Aspect**|**Details/Examples**|**Relevance to User's GCP VM Deployment**|
|**Model Type**|Typically per-instance subscription; bundles like NGINX One or consumption models like FCP also exist 61|Per-instance subscription most likely for GCP VMs.|
|**Common Tiers/Editions**|May include: Basic, Standard, Advanced, Enterprise; NGINX One packages 38|Specific tiers and included features to be confirmed with F5.|
|**Key Inclusions per Tier**|NGINX Plus core; may include Instance Manager, App Protect WAF, etc., depending on tier 61|User needs to select appropriate tier for required features.|
|**Typical Subscription Term**|Usually annual subscriptions 38|Annual subscription is standard.|
|**Support Level**|Standard 24x7 support; premium support options may be available 61|24x7 support is a key value of NGINX Plus.|
|**License Activation**|JWT license file (`license.jwt`) + usage reporting 45|JWT file must be correctly placed on each GCP instance, and reporting mechanism ensured.|

## 8. Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations

Synthesizing the analysis above, this report offers the following strategic recommendations regarding the core question of "is an upgrade necessary?":

**Upgrade Necessity Assessment:**

- **For CN Validation:** If the user's current CN validation logic is simple and effectively managed with NGINX Open Source's `map` directive or similar methods, and there's no short-term need to expand to more complex validation rules, the urgency to upgrade solely for this feature is low. However, if the CN validation logic is complex (e.g., involving multiple certificate fields, dynamic lists, integration with external identity systems), or if managing the current solution has become an operational burden, NGINX Plus, with its njs module and Key-Value Store, offers significant value and simplified management through programmability and dynamism.29
- **For Location and Path Routing:** If the current routing logic is primarily based on static rules and NGINX Open Source's `location` blocks and `rewrite` rules suffice, the need to upgrade is not strong. But if complex conditional routing based on multiple dynamic request attributes (like CN validation results, request headers, query parameters, etc.) is required, or if there's a desire to dynamically adjust routing policies via an API, NGINX Plus's njs and Key-Value Store provide far superior flexibility and power compared to open source.29
- **For L4 Proxy:** If the core L4 proxy requirement is port forwarding and basic TCP/UDP load balancing, NGINX Open Source is adequate. NGINX Plus's advantages lie in its enhanced health checks, richer monitoring metrics, and enterprise-grade features shared with L7 capabilities.
- **For Operations in GCP Environment:** If the user seeks higher levels of automation (e.g., seamless integration with GCP auto-scaling groups), deeper real-time monitoring, faster troubleshooting, more reliable high-availability solutions (especially clusters requiring configuration synchronization and state sharing), and enterprise-grade support, the value of NGINX Plus becomes very prominent.

Core Advantages Summary:

The core advantages of NGINX Plus lie in its enterprise-grade feature set and commercial support. Specifically:

1. **Advanced Feature Integration:** Active health checks 1, enhanced session persistence (like sticky learn) 4, dynamic configuration API 13, native JWT authentication 21, integrated WAF solution (NGINX App Protect) 16, rich live activity monitoring dashboard and metrics API 12, and advanced programmability via njs and Key-Value Store.29 These features are crucial for building and operating complex, highly available, and secure modern applications.
2. **Operational Efficiency and Agility:** The dynamic API avoids frequent configuration reloads, njs and the Key-Value Store simplify the implementation and management of complex logic, and enhanced monitoring speeds up problem identification. These contribute to improved operational efficiency and responsiveness to business changes.
3. **Reliability and Support:** Officially supported high-availability solutions (including configuration synchronization and state sharing) 17 and 24x7 enterprise-grade support 7 provide a solid foundation for mission-critical systems.

Potential Costs and Migration Considerations:

The primary cost is the NGINX Plus subscription fee.38 Migration effort depends on the complexity of the existing configuration, particularly the use of third-party modules.41 The team may need to invest time in learning NGINX Plus's new features.

**Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Strongly consider upgrading to NGINX Plus if one or more of the following conditions apply:**
    
    - Current CN validation or routing logic has become difficult to maintain, or there's a clear need for more dynamic, fine-grained control.
    - Strict requirements for application high availability and proactive failure detection exist.
    - Detailed real-time performance monitoring and rapid troubleshooting capabilities are needed.
    - Plans to achieve higher levels of operational automation in the GCP environment (e.g., integration with autoscaling).
    - API security (like JWT authentication) and advanced Web Application Firewall are key requirements.
    - Enterprise-grade support and SLAs are necessary to ensure business continuity.
2. **If NGINX Open Source currently meets needs stably and there are no such complex requirements in the short term, an upgrade can be deferred, but continuous monitoring is advised for:**
    
    - Changes in operational complexity: As business grows, the cost of manually managing advanced features might gradually exceed NGINX Plus licensing fees.
    - Evolution of security needs: New security threats or compliance requirements might necessitate the more advanced security features offered by NGINX Plus.
3. **Migration Strategy Recommendations (if deciding to upgrade):**
    
    - **Obtain a Trial License:** Contact F5/NGINX for a trial license of NGINX Plus to evaluate in a non-production environment.
    - **Conduct a Proof of Concept (PoC):** Select a non-critical but representative service for a migration PoC. Focus on testing the migration of CN validation, core routing logic, and try implementing one or two key NGINX Plus enhancements (e.g., active health checks, njs for some CN logic).
    - **Assess Third-Party Modules:** Carefully review third-party modules used in the current NGINX Open Source setup. Evaluate if they can be replaced by NGINX Plus native features or if recompilation is necessary.41
    - **Develop a Detailed Migration Plan:** Include steps for configuration backup, NGINX Plus installation and deployment, configuration file adaptation and testing, monitoring integration, HA configuration (if needed), etc.
    - **Phased Rollout:** Consider migrating services to the new NGINX Plus environment in stages, gradually replacing existing NGINX Open Source instances.
    - **Team Training:** Arrange training for operations and development teams on NGINX Plus-related features.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Internal Assessment:** Organize an internal technical team discussion based on this report's analysis, considering specific business pain points, future plans, and budget.
2. **Contact F5/NGINX:** Obtain the latest product information, detailed pricing, GCP Marketplace deployment options, and targeted technical consultation.
3. **Execute PoC:** If further evaluation is decided, initiate a PoC project as recommended above.

Through the above assessment and recommendations, the user should be able to more clearly determine if upgrading to F5 NGINX Plus aligns with their current and future strategic needs and technical objectives.

## Appendix (Optional)

### A.1. NGINX Plus Key Feature Configuration Snippets (Illustrative)

**A.1.1. Advanced CN Validation with njs (Conceptual Example)**

Nginx

```
# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
    js_path "/etc/nginx/njs/";
    js_import cn_validator from custom_cn_logic.js;

    map $ssl_client_s_dn_cn $cn_valid_user_role {
        default "none";
        # CN to role mapping here can be dynamically populated by njs or read from key-value store
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        #... ssl_certificate, ssl_certificate_key...
        ssl_client_certificate /path/to/ca.crt;
        ssl_verify_client on;

        location /sensitive_data/ {
            # njs can perform validation directly and decide access
            js_access cn_validator.validateAccess;

            # Or judge based on variables set by njs
            if ($cn_valid_user_role = "none") {
                return 403;
            }
            # proxy_pass http://backend_for_role_$cn_valid_user_role;
            proxy_pass http://backend_sensitive;
        }
    }
}
```

JavaScript

```
// /etc/nginx/njs/custom_cn_logic.js
function validateAccess(r) {
    const client_cn = r.variables.ssl_client_s_dn_cn;
    // Assume a function getRoleFromKV(cn) gets role from key-value store based on CN
    // let role = getRoleFromKV(client_cn);

    // Example: simple check based on CN suffix
    if (client_cn && client_cn.endsWith('.trusted.example.com')) {
        // r.variables.cn_valid_user_role = 'admin'; // Set variable for later use
        r.return(200); // Allow access
        return;
    }
    r.return(403); // Deny access
}

export default { validateAccess };
```

**A.1.2. Dynamic Routing with Key-Value Store (Conceptual Example)**

Nginx

```
# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
    keyval_zone zone=routing_kv:1m type=string; # Define key-value store zone [30]
    # API endpoint for managing key-value store (NGINX Plus R13+)
    # server {
    #     listen 8080; # Management port
    #     location /api {
    #         api write=on; # Allow writes [13, 14]
    #         # access control for API...
    #     }
    # }

    # Assume $routing_key is extracted from the request (e.g., part of path, user ID, or CN validation result)
    keyval $routing_key $target_upstream zone=routing_kv;

    upstream default_backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:8000;
    }

    map $target_upstream $final_backend {
        default $target_upstream; # Use if value exists in KV
        ""      http://default_backend; # Use default if no value in KV
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        location /app/ {
            # Assume $routing_key is already set (e.g., via map or njs)
            # set $routing_key $arg_user_id;
            proxy_pass $final_backend;
        }
    }
}
```

- **Managing Key-Value Store (Example API calls):**
    - Add routing rule: `curl -X POST -d '{"path_segment_A":"http://backend_A"}' http://localhost:8080/api/7/http/keyvals/routing_kv`
    - Query: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/7/http/keyvals/routing_kv`

**A.1.3. Active Health Check Configuration Example**

Nginx

```
# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
    upstream my_backend {
        zone backend_zone 64k; # Zone must be defined for active health checks [4]

        server backend1.example.com slow_start=30s; # Slow start [4]
        server backend2.example.com;

        # Active health check configuration [4, 5]
        health_check interval=5s fails=2 passes=2 uri=/healthz match=backend_ok;
    }

    match backend_ok { # Define conditions for successful health check [5]
        status 200;
        body ~ "OK";
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://my_backend;
        }
    }
}
```

**A.1.4. NGINX Plus API Dynamic Upstream Update Example**

- Assume `my_backend` upstream group is defined in `nginx.conf` with `zone` and API access enabled.
- Add new server: `curl -X POST -d '{"server":"backend3.example.com:80", "weight":10}' http://localhost:8080/api/7/http/upstreams/my_backend/servers` 13
- Mark server down: `curl -X PATCH -d '{"down":true}' http://localhost:8080/api/7/http/upstreams/my_backend/servers/0` (assuming backend1 is id 0) 13
