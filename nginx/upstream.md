The phrase **"upper part of the top plate"** appears to be a mistranslation or misphrasing of **"upstream"** in the context of proxy chains. In networking and proxy terminology (especially in Chinese technical contexts), **"upstream"** refers to the **server or service that a proxy forwards requests to** (i.e., the next layer in the request flow).

Let me clarify your scenario step by step:

**üîç Your Proxy Chain:** `A (Nginx)` ‚Üí `B (Squid)` ‚Üí `C (Kong)`

| Component | Role | Upstream (for this component) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A (Nginx)** | Frontend proxy | **B (Squid)** |
| **B (Squid)** | Reverse proxy | **C (Kong)** |
| **C (Kong)** | API gateway | **Upstream services** (e.g., your actual apps) |

**Why?**

*   **Nginx (A)** acts as a **reverse proxy** for clients. It receives requests from clients and forwards them to **Squid (B)**.
*   **Squid (B)** acts as a **cache/proxy** for Nginx. It receives requests from Nginx and forwards them to **Kong (C)**.
*   **Kong (C)** acts as an **API gateway** (e.g., routing requests to your backend services).

So, for **Nginx (A)**, its **upstream is Squid (B)** ‚Äî this is the server it proxies requests to.

**üéØ Why `proxy_buffering off;` Matters Here**

In your Nginx configuration, the line `proxy_buffering off;` controls **how Nginx handles the response from the upstream (Squid)**:

*   **Default (`proxy_buffering on`)**: Nginx buffers the entire upstream response before sending it to the client (e.g., for static files or slow responses).
*   **`proxy_buffering off`**: Nginx **immediately forwards the upstream response** (Squid's response) to the client **without buffering**.

**Why use this in your chain?**

*   If you want **real-time streaming** (e.g., SSE, WebSocket, or large file downloads), setting `proxy_buffering off` ensures:
    1.  Nginx doesn't wait to receive the full upstream response.
    2.  The client gets data **as it arrives** from Squid (no delays).
*   This is critical for your use case (e.g., Squid as a proxy for real-time traffic).

**‚úÖ Summary for Your Setup**

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **What is the upstream for Nginx (A)?** | **Squid (B)** |
| **What is the upstream for Squid (B)?** | **Kong (C)** |
| **Why set `proxy_buffering off;`?** | To avoid buffering Squid's responses ‚Üí **real-time streaming** (e.g., SSE/WebSockets) |

**üí° Practical Example**

Your Nginx configuration might look like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://squid;  # Squid is the upstream for Nginx
        proxy_buffering off;      # Critical for real-time traffic
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    }
}
```

This ensures:

1.  Nginx forwards requests to Squid (B).
2.  Nginx **immediately sends** Squid's response to clients (no buffering).
3.  Works perfectly for real-time protocols like WebSockets.

No tool calls are needed for this explanation. Let me know if you need help with the Nginx config or Squid tuning! üòä
