| GCP-CS-CTRL-2  | Cloud Audit Logs MUST be set up to log Admin Activity and Data Access for all buckets.                                                                                                                                                                          | Cloud services                            | Yes         | Yes      | Cloud Audit Logs are enabled by default at the organization level, logging Admin Activity and Data Access for all buckets.                                             |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-3  | aibang staff MUST be identified and authenticated to Cloud IAM via the strategic IDP, which effectively allows users to use their aibang credentials to authenticate to GCP.                                                                                        | Cloud Services <br> CAEP team             | Yes         | Yes      | All aibang staff are authenticated via the corporate strategic IDP, which is federated with GCP Cloud IAM.                                                               |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-4  | Data in the bucket MUST be encrypted at rest in accordance with the Cloud Data-at-Rest Encryption Security Pattern - 2024 - aibang Group Security Architecture - Confidential (ukbch).                                                                            | CAEP team                                 | Yes         | No       | Google-managed encryption keys are used for encryption at rest by default. The platform does not store user data, so user data encryption is not involved.             |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-6  | Storage Bucket permissions MUST be granted according to the principle of least privilege.                                                                                                                                                                       | CAEP team                                 | Yes         | No       | The principle of least privilege is ensured through regular permission audits, but real-time enforcement policies to prevent over-granting of permissions are lacking. |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-7  | The bucketAdmin role MUST NOT be used for Standard Bucket access.                                                                                                                                                                                               | CAEP team                                 | Yes         | No       | The platform discourages the use of the bucketAdmin role and promotes this through documentation and training, but it is not forcibly prohibited by technical means.   |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-8  | All buckets MUST enable uniform bucket-level access to prevent individual-object ACLs.                                                                                                                                                                          | Cloud Services                            | Yes         | Yes      | An organization policy enforces that all newly created buckets enable Uniform bucket-level access to disable object-level ACLs.                                        |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-9  | All buckets MUST include the data classification label identifying the highest classification level of the data stored in the bucket.                                                                                                                           | CAEP team                                 | Yes         | No       | The platform sets data classification labels for its own service buckets, but currently lacks automated validation and enforcement mechanisms.                         |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-10 | Access Transparency Logs MUST be enabled on all aibang GCP Projects.                                                                                                                                                                                              | Cloud Services                            | Yes         | Yes      | Access Transparency logs are enabled by default at the organization level to monitor the cloud provider's access operations on data.                                   |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-11 | Domain Restricted Sharing (DRS) MUST be on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Cloud Services                            | Yes         | Yes      | An organization policy enforces Domain Restricted Sharing, allowing data sharing only within aibang-authorized domains.                                                  |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-12 | Cloud Storage Pre-signed URLs MUST NOT be used to provide access to data classified as restricted or highly restricted.                                                                                                                                         | CAEP team                                 | NA          | No       | We are not using Cloud Storage Pre-signed URLs.                                                                                                                        |
| GCP-CS-CTRL-13 | Where an entity outside GCP connects to the GCP entity or resources via any method (e.g., Console, APIs, SDK), the connecting entity MUST ensure the communication is over a TLS connection using a TLS version and cipher-suite that meets the aibang Standards. | CAEP team                                 | NA          | No       | We do not have entities connecting from outside GCP.                                                                                                                   |
