Hi, I'm Lex from Aibang.
We have an API Platform, currently running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I would like to know the current status of Wiz's support for GCP.
Additionally, if we want to integrate with Wiz, what are the required procedures or steps?
I've referenced the following documentation.
Moreover, I have already completed the application for A and am now able to log in to the corresponding portal.
Key Terms & Explanations (in English):
• API Platform: A unified platform that provides standardized interfaces (APIs) to enable communication and integration between different systems or services.
• Google Cloud Platform (GCP): A cloud computing service offered by Google, providing infrastructure and tools for building, deploying, and managing applications.

• Portal: The web-based interface where users can manage accounts, configure settings, view dashboards, and perform administrative tasks within a system (e.g., Wiz).
