# 9 Types of API Testing

API testing is a critical part of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that your APIs are reliable, secure, and performant. Here are 9 common types of API testing:

1.  **Smoke Testing**: This is a preliminary testing phase to ensure that the most critical functions of an API are working as expected. It's a quick check to see if the build is stable enough for further testing.

2.  **Functional Testing**: This type of testing validates the functionality of an API against the specified requirements. It involves testing the API's endpoints with valid and invalid inputs to ensure that the API behaves as expected.

3.  **Integration Testing**: This testing focuses on verifying that different API modules or services work together as expected. It ensures that the communication and data flow between different parts of the application are correct.

4.  **Regression Testing**: Whenever there are changes to the codebase, regression testing is performed to ensure that the existing functionality of the API is not broken. It helps to maintain the stability of the application after new features or bug fixes are introduced.

5.  **Load Testing**: This testing is done to evaluate the performance of an API under a specific, expected load. It helps to determine the API's capacity and identify performance bottlenecks before they impact users.

6.  **Stress Testing**: This involves testing an API under extreme conditions, beyond its normal operational capacity. The goal is to identify the breaking point of the API and how it recovers from failure.

7.  **Security Testing**: This is a crucial testing phase to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in an API. It involves testing for common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication.

8.  **UI Testing**: This testing focuses on the user interface (UI) that interacts with the API. It ensures that the UI correctly displays the data received from the API and that the user interactions trigger the correct API calls.

9.  **Fuzz Testing**: This involves sending random, unexpected, and invalid data to an API to identify security vulnerabilities and other issues that might not be found with traditional testing methods.
